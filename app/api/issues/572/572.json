{"Description":"A blood pressure that is lower than the standard value is referred to as hypotension. It may lead to a situation where the heart, brain, and other parts of the body are undersupplied with blood. Normal blood pressure is usually with diastolic pressure between 60-90 mmHg and systolic pressure between 100-130 mmHg. Hypotension is defined as blood pressure below 100 mmHg systolic or 60 mmHg diastolic.","DescriptionShort":"Hypotension is the medical term for blood pressure that is measured lower than normal. Unlike high blood pressure, low blood pressure does no harm to the cardiovascular system but it can promote unpleasant symptoms such as dizziness and even syncopation. People with symptomatic hypotension should record their blood pressure and can take medications under a specialistâ€™s advice to maintain their blood pressure within a normal range.","MedicalCondition":"The cause for hypotension could be: 1) A sudden change of body position (orthostatic hypotension), standing too long (neutrally mediated hypotension) or heat. 2) Medicine against high blood pressure, anti-anxiety & anti-depressants, diuretics and painkiller, and other substances such as alcohol and drugs may lead to hypotension. 3) Diseases and conditions such as arrhythmia, endocrine disorders, infection, dehydration and heart failure. 4) Primary hypotension of unknown reason is more likely seen in slim women, often combined with physical inactivity. 5) Athletes may have an asymptomatic vagotonic hypotension. Slight hypotension normally does not lead to any symptoms. However, the most common symptoms include blurry vision, confusion, dizziness, syncope, nausea or vomiting, sleepiness and weakness.","Name":"Low blood pressure","PossibleSymptoms":"Dizziness,Increased thirst,Drowsiness,Blackening of vision,Unconsciousness, short","ProfName":"Hypotension","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Hypotension does only need treatment if it causes symptoms. The treatment of hypotension is aimed to increase blood pressure. Normally patients will be given: 1) medication to increase blood pressure and improve heart strength, 2) medicine according to specific symptoms, for instance antibiotics if there is an infection, 3) infusions in acute situations. Besides medication, drinking more fluids, getting up slowly from sitting or lying positions, not drinking alcohol, no prolonged standing and the avoidance of heat could also help to decrease the symptoms."}
