{"Description":"Hyperventilation syndrome consists in a predisposition towards hyperventilation (over inflation of the lungs with quick, deep breaths) without any apparent cause for it. Usually it occurs in the context of stress, anxiety, excitement, or panic. In this syndrome, the overbreathing is triggered by a specific group of symptoms. Even if hyperventilation syndrome can appear very similar to panic attacks, the two conditions are different. Usually, hyperventilation syndrome develops in context of stress, anxiety, excitement, or panic.","DescriptionShort":"Hyperventilation, called sometimes overbreathing, is breathing in excess of what the body needs. Sometimes, deep or rapid breathing is seen in very serious conditions such as heart attack, bleeding, or infection.","MedicalCondition":"Women in their 20s and 30s are affected the most.  During a hyperventilation attack, the patient develops feelings of narrowness in the chest, sharp chest pain and shortness of breath despite increased breathing.  Additionally, sensory disorders can be noticed, like  “pins and needles”, reduction of sense of touch. Hands can cramp up in a so-called “obstetrician’s hand”.  Shaking, headache, dizziness, and palpitations can also occur.  In rare cases, hyperventilation syndrome has a physical cause, but it is usually caused by psychological conditions.","Name":"Hyperventilation","PossibleSymptoms":"Tremor at rest,Cramps,Fast, deepened breathing,Unconsciousness, short,Dizziness,Tingling,Nervousness,Headache,Difficulty to concentrate,Tiredness,Anxiety,Blackening of vision","ProfName":"Hyperventilation syndrome","Synonyms":"Overbreathing","TreatmentDescription":"During a hyperventilation attack, the patient should be calmed down and made to breathe into a bag. After an accurate diagnostic of the condition, the doctor will arrange, if the syndrome is not really serious, follow-up care with a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist who will teach the patient about the condition and techniques to help control the attacks. Breathing exercises and psychosomatic therapy can help to identify an attack early on and to stop it with measured breathing. Sometimes, certain medicine can be prescribed after a follow-up care. With appropriate training, the patient may use stress reducing techniques, breathing exercises and certain medication to reduce the severity and number of the attacks. These attacks can be reduced also with therapy for any other anxiety issue."}
