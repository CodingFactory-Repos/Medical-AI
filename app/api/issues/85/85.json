{"Description":"Arteriosclerosis happens when the walls of the arteries lose their elasticity and become hard and thick. Arteries are blood vessels that transport oxygen and important nutrients from the heart to other parts of the body. The hardening of these arteries restricts sometimes blood to flow to the tissues and organs. The plaques in the walls of arteries can burst, causing a blood clot. Even if atherosclerosis, which is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, is understood often as a heart condition, it can happen in arteries located in other parts of the body. The condition is treatable and can be prevented.","DescriptionShort":"Arteriosclerosis, also called atherosclerosis, is a systemic disease of the arterial blood vessels that leads to a hardening of the arteries caused by an accumulation of blood lipids, blood clots (thrombi), connective tissue, and sometimes local inflammation forming plaques (lime) along the walls inside the vessels.","MedicalCondition":"Arteriosclerosis and the illnesses that result from it are the most common cause of death in industrial countries. Risk factors for developing arteriosclerosis include: high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, increase in blood lipids (especially cholesterol), diabetes, being overweight, a diet rich in calories and fats, lack of exercise, and stress. Men and the elderly are more likely to be affected and it tends to run in families. The disease may not show any symptoms at first, until signs such as circulation disorders, blood clots, heart attacks, stroke, or sudden death occur.","Name":"Hardening of the walls of arteries","PossibleSymptoms":"Impairment of male potency,Visual field loss,Vomiting,Nausea,Abdominal pain,Neck pain,Back pain,Pain in the calves,Weakness or numbness on right or left side of body,Shortness of breath,Chest tightness,Chest pain,Difficulty in finding words,Tiredness,Pain when chewing,Cold sweats,Feeling faint,Disorientation regarding time or place,Muscle weakness,Impaired balance,Pain radiating to the arm,Drowsiness","ProfName":"Arteriosclerosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Diseases that result from arteriosclerosis include coronary artery disease with accompanying chest pain (angina pectoris), heart attack, stroke, and smokerâ€™s leg (see the corresponding articles).
