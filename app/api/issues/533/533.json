{"Description":"A strain is an injury of the muscles or tendons which happens when they are overstretched. A torn muscle fibre occurs when the muscle is overstretched in a way that single muscle fibres tear and bleed. A sprain is an injury of the ligaments which happens when a joint is twisted and the ligaments get stretched. If the ligaments are overstretched in a way that they tear, it is called a torn ligament. A sprain often affects the joints in the fingers, wrists, ankles, knees, and toes.","DescriptionShort":"A strain is an injury of either a muscle or a tendon, and a sprain is an injury of a ligament of a joint. Strain and sprain are normally caused by twisting, stretching, traumas or sports injuries. The principles of RICE (rest, icing, compression and elevation) can relieve the discomforts, and medications such non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce the symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"Strain: The causes of a strain include heavy pulling forces on tendons or muscles, such as overstretching the muscles or other injuries that damages the muscles or tendons. Sometimes lifting too heavy objects can also result in a strain. Strains can occur in every muscle and tendon. However, the muscle of the back, arms and thighs are the most commonly affected areas. People with a strain can experience symptoms such as muscular pain, swelling, limitation of movement and even muscle spasms. If a muscle or tendon is torn, a subcutaneous bleeding is typically visible. Sprain: The causes of sprain include twisting, falling, or other sports injuries, which can distort a joint and damage the ligaments. It often occurs in joints such as the wrists, ankles, or knees. People with a sprain may experience symptoms such as pain of the joints, swelling, and limited movement of joints. If a ligament is torn, it typically leads to local subcutaneous bleeding and in addition to long-lasting instability in the joint.","Name":"Strain, sprain or weakness of the muscle tendon unit and ligaments","PossibleSymptoms":"Joint instability,Morning stiffness,Joint swelling,Joint pain,Hand swelling,Ankle swelling,Limited mobility of the back,Limited mobility of the leg,Limited mobility of the fingers,Limited mobility of the ankle,Knee pain,Physical inactivity,Foot swelling,Difficulty with gait,Arm pain,Leg pain,Hand pain,Elbow pain,Back pain","ProfName":"Strain or sprain injury of the muscle tendon unit and ligaments","Synonyms":"Pulled muscle,Muscle strain","TreatmentDescription":"It is important to follow the principles of RICE, which refers to rest, icing, compression and elevation. These principles can help to relieve the discomfort and accelerate the healing process. In addition, medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce the symptoms of pain and inflammation. After the treatment, physical therapy can help people regain muscle power and stability in the joint, and rehabilitate the affected area. If a torn ligament leads to permanent instability, surgery may be considered in order to stabilize the joint."}
