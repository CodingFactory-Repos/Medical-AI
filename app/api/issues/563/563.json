{"Description":"Aortic regurgitation lets a part of the blood that was just propelled out of the key pumping cavity of the heart to return into it. This inflow can stop the heart from  pumping blood effectively to other parts of the body. This causes fatigue and makes a person to have a short breath. The condition can develop over decades or suddenly. Once the condition becomes serious, surgery is often  needed to replace or repair the aortic valve.","DescriptionShort":"Aortic regurgitation describes a condition when the aortic valve cannot close sufficiently and blood is able to flow back from the aorta into the left heart ventricle. It is mostly caused by a dysfunction of the aortic valve and rarely by an abnormality of the aorta. Minor asymptomatic forms do not need any treatment. More severe forms can be treated with medications or surgery.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of aortic regurgitation include valvular dysfunctions and abnormalities of the ascending aorta. 1) Valvular dysfunction: congenital valvular disorders such as a bicuspid aortic valve cause more frequently valvular dysfunctions. But acquired causes like rheumatic fever, endocarditis, degenerative aortic valve diseases (aortic sclerosis), trauma and surgery are the most common causes of valvular dysfunctions and aortic regurgitation. 2) Aorta abnormalities: expansion of the aorta may also lead to an insufficient closure of the aortic valves and cause reverse blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle. Therefore an aortic sclerosis, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a dissection of the aorta may also result in aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can occur either acute or chronic. Acute aortic regurgitation can manifest with the sudden appearance of significant symptoms such as pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock and heart failure. Chronic aortic regurgitation normally happens gradually and can lead to an enlargement of the heart and end in a heart failure. The symptoms of chronic aortic regurgitation are gradually increasing shortness of breath, palpitations, pressure on the chest and loss of physical resilience.","Name":"Inadequate closure of the aortic valve","PossibleSymptoms":"Shortness of breath,Night cough,Blackening of vision,Palpitations,Chest pain,Pallor,Tiredness,Feeling faint,Heart murmur,Irregular heartbeat","ProfName":"Aortic insufficiency","Synonyms":"Inadequate closure of the aortic valve of the heart,Leaking of the aortic valve of the heart","TreatmentDescription":"Minor asymptomatic forms do not need any treatment but a regular check-up. Treatments of aortic regurgitation include: 1) medication: vasodilators (ACE-inhibitors) can help to improve the ejection fraction of the heart, lower the aortic pressure and reduce reverse blood flow. Antibiotics may be used if there is an endocarditis. 2) Surgical intervention in order to repair the aortic valves or the aorta will be considered in severe cases."}
