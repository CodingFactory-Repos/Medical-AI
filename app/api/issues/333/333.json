{"Description":"The esophagus is a long and hollow tube, which connects the throat with the stomach, and its purpose is to transport food into the stomach. Esophageal corrosion is a form of esophageal inflammation (esophagitis) with extensive alteration of the mucosa, which is caused by harmful substances that damage the mucous membrane and other esophageal tissues in event of contact.","DescriptionShort":"Esophageal corrosion occurs when harmful substances pass through the esophagus. These substances can damage the mucosa of the esophagus in event of contact. The treatment may include medication to alleviate the symptoms, performing a dilatation of the esophagus, and even surgery to remove severely damaged part of the esophagus.","MedicalCondition":"There are various substances that can cause esophageal corrosion. The three most common substances include: 1) Caustic substances: people may drink this type of substance accidentally or with suicidal purpose. Some of these substances are common in daily life, for example cleaners, acids, alkalis, and other strong chemicals. 2) Boiling fluids: very hot fluids can cause burning of the esophageal mucosa. 3) Pills: Some pills contain substances that are toxic for the mucosa. If such pills are stuck in the esophagus, they can also damage its tissues. Besides esophageal corrosion, there are some more reasons for an inflammation of the esophagus, such as radiation therapy, infections with viruses and fungi, and the most common is reflux of gastric acid (see also gastric reflux disease). People with esophageal inflammations often have symptoms such as pain during swallowing, difficulty in swallowing, esophageal stricture, loss of appetite and even bleeding.","Name":"Esophageal corrosion","PossibleSymptoms":"Shortness of breath,Difficulty in swallowing,Pain on swallowing,Burning in the throat,Chest pain","ProfName":"Caustic esophageal injury","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of esophageal corrosion includes: 1) medication: antibiotic drugs will be used to prevent further infections, steroids can help decrease inflammation, stomach acid blockers can help reduce the additional irritation from stomach acid, and antiulcer medications can help the esophagus to heal. 2) Dilatation: esophageal corrosion may also result in esophageal stricture due to the development of scars. Therefore it is sometimes necessary to perform a dilatation of the esophagus. 3) Surgery: in severe cases surgery may be needed to remove the irreparably damaged parts of the esophagus."}
