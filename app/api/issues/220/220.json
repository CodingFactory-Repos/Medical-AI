{"Description":"Diphtheria is an infectious disease that is transmitted via moisture droplets. The bacteria (Corynebacerium diphteriae) mostly affects the nose and throat. The bacteria produces toxins, released into its surroundings and when absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract, it can lead to serious heart and nervous system complications and may even lead to death. The disease can be fought with a vaccination in childhood. Itâ€™s important to get vaccinated against diphtheria before and after the infection in order to prevent common complications.","DescriptionShort":"Diphtheria is a bacterial infection, which is contagious.

The tonsils may also be framed with red, but they generally do not hurt. The covering can turn greyish or brown, but can bleed if attempts to remove it are made. A sweetish smell may come from the mouth. At this stage the lymph nodes in the throat swell considerably. Additionally, patients complain of difficulty swallowing, nausea and vomiting, exhaustion, and joint issues. Fever is often associated. Exotoxins (see above) can also cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis). This serious condition can lead to heart rhythm disorders and in extreme cases it can lead to cardiac arrest.","Name":"Infection caused by corynebacterium diphtheriae","PossibleSymptoms":"Shortness of breath,Fever,Sore throat,Cough,Tiredness,Runny nose,Pain on swallowing,Nausea,Swollen glands in the neck,Difficulty in swallowing","ProfName":"Diphtheria","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"A suspected diphtheria infection can be confirmed by swabbing the throat and identifying pathogens.
