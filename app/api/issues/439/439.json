{"Description":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus or SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s defense (immune) system mistakenly attacks healthy cells. Antibodies are produced, which then attack the body’s own cells, and are thus called autoantibodies. The result is a prolonged inflammatory reaction in various organs. The cause of SLE is currently not known.","DescriptionShort":"Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s defense (immune) system attacks healthy cells.
