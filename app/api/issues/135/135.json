{"Description":"Carpal tunnel is located on the inside part of the wrist.  The carpal tunnel is a canal that is surrounded on one side by the carpal bones and on the other side by ligaments.  Tendons and nerves run through this canal. If the canal becomes too narrow, then increased pressure and constriction of the nerves result in typical symptoms. Narrowing of the canal can have many results that are not always associated with a medical condition. For example, narrowing of the canal can be caused by the swelling of soft tissues during pregnancy, from regular physical work with the hands, or due to other conditions that involve the swelling of the hands.","DescriptionShort":"Carpal tunnel syndrome is often experienced as sensations of paresthesia or numbness in the hand that occur during vigorous activities. The reason for these sensations is the constriction of a nerve called the nervus medianus.","MedicalCondition":"Most female patients tend to feel paresthesia (numbness, tingling) at the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome during strenuous activities like bicycle riding, as well as pains in the fingers and palms. Later, symptoms occur even at night. Patients often report alleviation of symptoms when shaking their hands out.","Name":"Nerve compression in the wrist","PossibleSymptoms":"Numbness of the hands,Tingling,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Hand pain,Limited mobility of the fingers,Muscular weakness in the arm,Numbness in the arm,Hand swelling,Arm swelling","ProfName":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","Synonyms":"CTS","TreatmentDescription":"Due to damage to the nerves, in the later stages carpal tunnel syndrome can result in muscular atrophy of the thumb. Early treatment can prevent this. Treatment usually begins with wearing bandages, taking anti-inflammatory medication, and cold therapy to improve symptoms. In later stages of carpal tunnel syndrome, operation is common. Operation involves dividing the constricted ligament in two. This involves a small operation with very good chances of success."}
