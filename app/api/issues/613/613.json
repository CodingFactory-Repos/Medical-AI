{"Description":"Dental caries describes a disease of the teeth, where holes form in the teeth. The holes are caused by bacteria in the plaque. Dental caries starts from the surface of a tooth, which is called enamel. Without proper treatment, caries will reach the nerve of a tooth and cause symptoms such as toothache or an abscess.","DescriptionShort":"Dental caries forms when plaque starts to damage the enamel, which results in holes in the tooth. It will not only damage the surface, but break through the enamel and the dentin and reach the nerve of a tooth. The treatment includes fillings, crowns, root canal therapy and the removal of the decayed tooth. It is recommended to visit a dentist if dental caries is present in order to prevent further damage.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of dental caries is mainly plaque. Plaque is a biofilm made up of saliva, food, bacteria and acid. It can adhere to the inside of the mouth, especially the teeth, and damage the surface of the teeth, which is called enamel. Plaque often starts to accumulate in the mouth after eating. Some of the bacteria living in plaque are able to destroy enamel. These bacteria get promoted by the presence of sugar. Once the enamel is damaged, holes begin to form on the surface of the tooth and the bacteria spread deeper into the tooth. People with dental caries may have symptoms such as bad breath, toothache, holes on the tooth, pain while chewing, and tooth sensitivity. Furthermore, it may lead to an inflammation, an infection or even an abscess of the tooth.","Name":"Caries","PossibleSymptoms":"Face pain,Toothache,Pain when chewing,Mouth pain","ProfName":"Dental caries","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"It is important to practice good oral hygiene in order to avoid dental caries. Here are some guidelines that can help to prevent dental caries.

However, the treatment of dental caries includes 1) fillings (for mild dental caries), 2) crowns (for dental caries that have weakened the structure of a tooth), 3) root canal therapy (for dental caries that have affected the nerve of a tooth) and 4) the removal of a tooth (for a seriously damaged tooth)."}
