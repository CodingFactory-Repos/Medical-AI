{"Description":"The tendon connecting the biceps to the shoulder and elbow can rupture with a very strong contraction of the biceps muscle with a pop noise and pain. Many people can still operate with a biceps tendon tear and need only simple treatments to relieve symptoms. However, surgery may be required to repair the torn tendon for complete recovery of strength.","DescriptionShort":"Tendons connect muscles to bones. The bicep tendons connect the biceps muscle to the bones in the elbow and in the shoulder. A disruption of the biceps tendon at the shoulder can trigger a loss of strength in the arm accompanied by pain when the patient turns his arm forcefully from a palm down to a palm up movement. The tendon in the bicep often tears when it has previously been damaged, normally by lifting weights that are heavier than normal.","MedicalCondition":"Many patients report hearing the rip as it happened (a snap like breaking a tree branch). Pain immediately sets in. There is a noticeable change in the outside contour of the upper arm. In contrast to a healthy arm, an arm with a ripped tendon will show a depression in the upper half of the upper arm and a noticeable bulge in the lower half.","Name":"Tear of the biceps tendon","PossibleSymptoms":"Muscular weakness in the arm,Pain radiating to the arm","ProfName":"Rupture of the biceps tendon","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"A doctor can confirm the presence of a ripped biceps tendon with an ultrasound. In most cases the condition is treated conservatively, without an operation. Since the pain goes away after several days, the arm can be placed in a special bandage for 4 to 6 days and kept in place. After resting, the muscle can begin to be rebuilt. A loss of strength when bending the elbow or when turning the forearm does not generally occur. Undergoing operation is only necessary when the contour of the upper arm is cosmetically undesirable for the patient."}
