{"Description":"A scoliosis describes the abnormal curvature of the spine. The spine is often C- or S-shaped. It can either exist since birth or can manifest itself later on. It can result in a hump in the rip, lumbar bulge, low-hanging shoulders and deformations of the vertebra.","DescriptionShort":"A scoliosis describes the lateral curvature of the spine. Often the spine is C- or S- shaped. It is important to recognize the formation of a scoliosis early and then to start appropriate treatments and adjustments. However, the treatment will depend on the specific scoliosis, sometimes a surgery will be needed.","MedicalCondition":"There are several kinds of scoliosis including: 1) Idiopathic scoliosis: it can be grouped by age, for example, infantile scoliosis for children below 3 years old, juvenile scoliosis for children at age 4-10, adolescent scoliosis for children at age 11-18. 2) Congenital scoliosis: people with congenital scoliosis are born with the disease. It happens due to the abnormal development of a babyâ€™s ribs or spine. 3) Neuromuscular scoliosis: it results from a problem of nervous system, which can affect the muscles. 4) Growth too fast: people are prone to have an abnormal curvature of spine due to a growth spurt. People with scoliosis almost have no symptoms. If there are any, they may be backache or low back pain, tired feeling in the spine, uneven hips or shoulder, and spine curves more to one side.","Name":"Curvature of the spine","PossibleSymptoms":"Curvature of the spine,Back pain,Back deformity,Palpitations,Shortness of breath,Limited mobility of the back","ProfName":"Scoliosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment will depend on the specific scoliosis. For example, people with idiopathic scoliosis normally do not require treatments. However, they should go regularly to a doctor to check the condition every 6 months. For people who are still growing, the doctor may recommend a back brace to avoid the further abnormal curvature of spine. The best timing to use back braces is for people who are more than 10 years old. However, the back braces cannot work for people with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis. For some severe cases, a surgery is needed. After a surgery, the doctor may also refer the patient to a physical therapist."}
