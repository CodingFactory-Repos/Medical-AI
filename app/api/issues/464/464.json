{"Description":"Cervical spondylosis is a form of arthritis in the cervical spine. It occurs when there is abnormal wear and tear in the cervical spinal disks. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, bone spurs and other signs of osteoarthritis may develop.","DescriptionShort":"Cervical spondylosis is an inflammation in the cervical spine. It often results in a chronic pain of the neck. Medication such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) or narcotics can relieve the pain. If necessary, surgery will be needed.","MedicalCondition":"As people age, the bones and cartilage, which make up the backbone and neck, will gradually develop wear and tear. These changes may include dehydrated disks, herniated disks, bone spurs and immobile ligaments. The common risk factors of getting cervical spondylosis include: 1) Age: spinal disks tend to dehydrate and shrink when people are aging. 2) Occupation: certain jobs may place extra stress on the neck. For example, repetitive neck motions, awkward positioning or a lot of overhead work will increase the risk of getting cervical spondylosis. 3) Neck injuries: previous neck injuries also increase the risk of cervical spondylosis. 4) Genetic factors: Cervical spondylosis may make people experience symptoms like headaches, neck stiffness, and numbness or abnormal sensations of the neck and the upper extremities such as the shoulders and arms.","Name":"Spondylosis of cervical spine","PossibleSymptoms":"Neck pain,Numbness in the arm,Pain radiating to the arm,Limited mobility of the back","ProfName":"Cervical spondylosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of cervical spondylosis includes medication or surgery.
