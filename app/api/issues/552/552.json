{"Description":"After the skin is injured, the scar tissue will try to repair the injured skin by forming a scar. For some people, the scar tissue will grow excessively or even keep forming after the wound has healed. This extra scar tissue will result in a red or flesh-colored, raised scar on the skin, which is called a keloid. Keloids do not usually hurt, but they may cause itchiness or sensitivity of the skin.","DescriptionShort":"A keloid describes excessive scar tissue, which is firm, smooth, irregular and raised on the skin. The scar is not harmful to the human body. Treatment is therefore not necessary. However, there are ways to remove the scar.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of keloids are any injuries or damage to the skin, which can result in wounds. During the process of healing, scar tissue will repair the injured area. If the scar overgrows and becomes raised on the skin, then it is considered as a keloid. Keloids often occur on the skin of the upper trunk, arms, legs, ears and neck, and will appear at the site of a previous wound. A keloid is firm, smooth, has irregular nodules, and the color can be either red or the color of the skin. The common conditions that can cause keloids include acne, burns, chickenpox, scratches, surgical wounds, trauma wounds, and vaccinations.","Name":"Keloidal scar","PossibleSymptoms":"Hardening of the skin,Skin thickening,Scar","ProfName":"Keloid","Synonyms":"Keloid scar,Wound keloid,Keloid sore","TreatmentDescription":"Keloids normally do not need any treatment.
