{"Description":"Ulnar nerve entrapment, or cubital tunnel syndrome, is a condition that involves stretching or pressure to the ulnar nerve. The common symptoms of cubital tunnel syndrome include numbness or unresponsiveness and tingling in the little finger and ring finger. The nerve runs in a groove on the inner side of the elbow. Baseball pitchers are among the persons who are likely to develop the condition. This is because these players have to twist their hands in order to throw a slider. This motion can injury delicate ligaments that are within the elbow. The entrapment of the ulnar nerve is the second most common cause of nerve entrapment in the body. The most common is carpal tunnel syndrome with entrapment of the median nerve.","DescriptionShort":"Ulnar nerve entrapment is a condition due to irritation and compression of the ulnar nerve (nervus ulnaris) of the arm. The cause is mostly located at the cubital tunnel (sulcus ulnaris), where the nerve is most exposed to outer influences. The ulnar nerve is located in the arms so the symptoms often affect the fingers, hands, forearms and elbows. People with the problem are usually treated with medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), wearing splints, occupational therapy and in some cases surgery.","MedicalCondition":"The main cause of ulnar nerve entrapment is the compression of the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel (sulcus ulnaris). There are many conditions that can cause compression of the ulnar nerve. For example, keeping the elbow bent for a long period may compress the ulnar nerve and then lead to ulnar nerve entrapment. In addition, fractures, bone spurs, swelling of the elbow joint, cysts near the elbow joint and repetitive activities may also increase the risk of getting the condition. Since the ulnar nerve can affect movement and sensation, if it is injured an abnormal sensation and weakness in some muscles may occur. The common symptoms include: weakness or muscular atrophy in the hand (especially the abduction of the fourth finger is weakened), tingling or numbness in the palm and fourth or fifth finger, sensitivity to cold and tenderness in the elbow joint. A typical phenomenon is a tingling sensation in the fourth finger during percussion of the cubital tunnel.","Name":"Ulnar nerve entrapment","PossibleSymptoms":"Numbness of the hands,Tingling,Finger deformity,Pain radiating to the arm,Arm pain,Numbness in the arm","ProfName":"Cubital tunnel syndrome","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of ulnar nerve entrapment includes medication, accessory appliances, occupational therapy and sometimes surgery. Generally speaking, medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to reduce the pain and inflammation. Also, wearing splints can help to immobilize the elbow to facilitate recovery. Occupational therapy may be recommended to strengthen and regain muscle power. In some cases, surgery may also be considered in order to relieve discomfort."}
