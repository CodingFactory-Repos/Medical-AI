{"Description":"Based on the underlying reason of the infection, Paronychia may suddenly start and then last just for one to two days. It may also appear slowly and then last for some weeks. Paronychia's symptoms can easily be detected. They can be treated successfully with little to no damage for the nails and skin. However, if a paronychia is not treated, then the infection may become serious and can even lead to a partial or total loss of a person's nail.","DescriptionShort":"Paronychia is a skin infection around the toenails and fingernails with pus, redness and pain. The infection is bacterial and is often caused by staphylococcus or also by a yeast named Candida which is causing the Paronychia. Yeast and bacteria can even combinedly lead to an infection.","MedicalCondition":"There are various causes of paronychia. The infection can either develop fast and occur acutely around the fingernails or show up slowly and become chronic on a person's toes or fingers. The reason is either a bacteria, named Staphylococcus, or a yeast, named Candida, or the mixture of two bacterial or fungal agents. A bactery or fungus can penetrate the skin at the border of the nail through any kind of trauma such as caused by biting nails, being punctured by a manicurist tool, pushing down the cuticle too aggressively or further sorts of similar injuries. This leads to an acute infection. Chronic infection is often caused by Candida yeast but a bacteria can also be the origin. Since yeast grows well on wet environments, this chronic infection is caused often by having the hands or feet in water for a long period of time. The symptoms of both chronic and acute paronychia are very similar and include blisters filled with pus, redness and tenderness of the skin around the nail, changes in the shape, texture, and color of the nail, as well as detachment of the nail.","Name":"Inflammation of the nail skin","PossibleSymptoms":"Changes in the nails,Hand swelling,Skin lesion,Skin redness,Hand pain,Finger swelling,Finger pain","ProfName":"Paronychia","Synonyms":"Whitlow,Felon","TreatmentDescription":"To prevent paronychia care should be taken by keeping the hands and feet clean to stop bacteria or fungus from slipping between skin and nails. One can prevent acute infections by avoiding trauma caused by pedicures, manicures, or biting. It should also be avoided to expose the paronychia to wet environments and water for a longer time of period to help to prevent a chronic infection. Home treatments are often very effective for mild cases. Soaking the infected area numerous times per day in hot water and applying antibiotic ointment is recommended. If the infection is not showing improvement with home treatments or if it is more severe, a doctor can prescribe an antibiotic to be taken orally. It might also be needed to have abscesses or blisters cut and drained of fluids in order to speed the healing and relieving the discomfort. It must be prevented that when the infection progresses that for an example an inflammation spreads to the tendon sheaths of the palm of the hand."}
