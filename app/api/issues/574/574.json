Some chronic diseases such as lupus can also show in an inflammation of the scalp. It is important to note that lack of hygiene is certainly a risk factor for a scalp infection, but not every scalp infection is caused by lack of hygiene.","DescriptionShort":"An infection of the scalp occurs when an infectious element caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites attacks the skin located on the head.
