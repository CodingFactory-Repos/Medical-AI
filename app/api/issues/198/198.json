Sometimes a Baker’s cyst causes no other symptoms other than the swelling at the back of the knee. In rare cases, a Baker’s cyst can burst, causing the fluid to leak down in a person's calf and this can cause redness, swelling, and sharp pain in the calf.","DescriptionShort":"A Baker’s cyst (also popliteal cyst) develops in the popliteal space of the knee, usually in connection with a chronic infection around the knee joint. It is caused when the tissue behind the knee joint becomes jammed and inflamed.","MedicalCondition":"Baker’s cysts usually develop in connection with other conditions that cause an increased accumulation of fluids in the knee joint (inflammatory-rheumatic diseases, chronic arthritis).
