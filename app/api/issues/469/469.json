{"Description":"The temporomandibular joint connects the skull to the jawbone and a dysfunction of this joint can make the movement difficult and the muscles can struggle to control the jaw motion. It is often hard to determine the cause of such dysfunction since the pain can be caused by a combination of numerous factors including jaw injury, arthritis, and genetics. Some patients with a temporomandibular joint dysfunction tend to grind or clench their teeth even if many people grind or clench usually their teeth without developing the condition. Usually, the discomfort and pain connected to a temporomandibular joint dysfunction is temporary. Nonsurgical treatments or self-handled care are the first line of options to alleviate the symptoms. Typically, surgery is only the ultimate option after failure of conservative measures. However, some patients with the condition may need surgical measures to improve the condition and to recover.","DescriptionShort":"Temporomandibular joint and muscle dysfunction, which is commonly called TMJ syndrome is a disorder of the jaw joint and the chewing muscles. Pain while chewing is one of the main symptoms experienced by patients as well as a dysfunction in the jaw joint and the muscles controlling the jaw movement. There are many ways to prevent and if needed to treat a TMJ syndrome. If the disorder still occurs, anti-inflammatory drugs and others painkillers may be used. Furthermore, in severe cases, surgery may be performed.","MedicalCondition":"In TMJ syndrome, displacement of the cartilage disc in the joint of the jaw that causes pressure and stretching of the associated sensory nerves may be present. Popping or clicking occurs when the disk snaps into place as the jaw moves. In addition, the chewing muscles may spasm, not function efficiently, and cause pain and tenderness. Causes of TMJ syndrome may include 1) trauma to the jaw, 2) teeth grinding, 3) excessive chewing of chewing-gum, 4) improper bite or malposition of the jaw, 5) arthritis, 6) stress or other psychological factors. People with TMJ syndrome often have symptoms such as ear pain, sore jaw muscles, cheek pain, jaw popping or clicking, locking of the jaw, difficulty in opening the mouth fully and head or neck aches.","Name":"Temporomandibular joint dysfunction","PossibleSymptoms":"Face pain,Lockjaw,Earache,Pain when chewing,Mouth pain","ProfName":"TMJ syndrome","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"To avoid TMJ syndrome, you can follow these tips: 1) rest the muscles and joints by eating soft foods, 2) do not chew chewing-gum, 3) avoid clenching your teeth and 4) relax muscles with moist heat. In cases of joint injury, apply ice packs soon after the injury to reduce swelling. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants or other painkillers may also be used. Other treatments for advanced cases may include fabrication of an occlusal splint for use at night to prevent wear and tear on the joint, improving the alignment of the upper and lower teeth. Sometimes surgery may be needed."}
