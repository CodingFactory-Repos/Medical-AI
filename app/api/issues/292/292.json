{"Description":"People suffering from mania are under the impression of being unrestrictedly strong and able to do everything they plan. They are in an exhilarated mood, laugh often, even in inappropriate situations and often talk continuously.","DescriptionShort":"Mania is a psychological condition that shows in enhanced, mostly euphoric moods in inappropriate situations. Contrary to persons suffering from depression, patients with a mania find it very difficult to keep calm.","MedicalCondition":"Manic people are distracted easily, they can’t concentrate at all or only for a short period of time and, as mentioned above, talk very fast more or less continuously and often to themselves, they “gabble along”. Sometimes patients show symptoms that are equivalent to delusions; they overestimate themselves, can’t recognise interrelationships anymore or draw the wrong conclusions.","Name":"Mental illness with euphoria and hyperactivity","PossibleSymptoms":"Increased drive,Sleeplessness,Difficulty to concentrate,Mood swings,Agitation,Aggressiveness","ProfName":"Mania","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Because of the common combination of delusions and self-overestimation, manic persons are usually only partly criminally liable and not legally competent. In most cases the acute-phase requires a compulsory hospitalization to protect others, but mainly the patients themselves, and to begin treatment. Beginning a therapy during the acute-phase is difficult, as the patients often lack any understanding of the disease. However, it can be treated with various medication, psychotherapy and ergo therapy."}
