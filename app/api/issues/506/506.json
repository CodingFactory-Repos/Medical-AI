{"Description":"A neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a dysfunction of the nervous system, which affects the function of the urinary tracts. It is a condition when the responsible nerves, which control how the muscles of bladder store or empty urine, cannot function as normal. Dependent on the type of neuronal dysfunction, this results in either an overactive or an underactive bladder. Urinary retention, and incontinence of urine are the main symptoms.","DescriptionShort":"Neurogenic bladder dysfunction is a condition when the nerves cannot control the muscles of bladder, which then results in urinary problems such as incontinence and urinary retention. It is necessary to visit an urologist for a further check.","MedicalCondition":"The normal process of urination requires the muscles and nerves of the bladder to work together in order to control when to relax and tighten the muscles, this way the process of urination is coordinated. A neurogenic bladder dysfunction mainly results from disorders related to the central nervous system, for example, Alzheimer disease, congenital problems of the spinal cord, tumors in the brain or spinal cord, cerebral palsy, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, injuries of the spine, and stroke. The result of neuronal damage may be an overactive or underactive bladder, depending on the localization of damage. People with an overactive bladder may have symptoms like 1) frequent urination with sudden urge, 2) difficulty in emptying the bladder completely, 3) inability to urinate deliberately.  People with an underactive bladder may have symptoms like 1) full bladder and urine leakage in drops (overflow bladder), 2) tenderness of the bladder, 3) difficulty in emptying the bladder deliberately, and 4) urine retention. All types of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions lead to difficulties in emptying the bladder completely, which highly increase the risk for an infection of the bladder.","Name":"Nerve-related bladder dysfunction","PossibleSymptoms":"Feeling of residual urine,Urination during the night,Dribbling after urination,Delayed start to urination","ProfName":"Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in men","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of a neurogenic bladder dysfunction include medication, catheterization or surgery. Medications for neurogenic bladder dysfunction relax the muscles, decrease the obstruction, and strengthen the muscle strength of the bladder. If necessary, surgery can be considered. Following certain treatments, physical therapy is often necessary for an improvement of bladder function. In severe cases only catheterization can help the patient to gain control of the urinary habits."}
