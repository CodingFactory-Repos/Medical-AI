{"Description":"A tarsal tunnel syndrome results from an improper compression of the nerve of the tibia (nervus tibialis). Depending on the compression, it may lead to symptoms such as tingling, burning, numbness, or pain along the nerve of the tibia at the inner side and the sole of the affected foot.","DescriptionShort":"An improper compression of the nerve of the tibia may result in a tarsal tunnel syndrome. It can cause eradiating pain along the nerve of the tibia on the inner side and the sole of the foot. Treatment includes medication and assisting devices. For severe cases, a surgery may be necessary.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of a tarsal tunnel syndrome is mainly the improper compression of the tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel, which is built by the inner side of the ankle and the fibrous retaining band (the retinaculum flexorum). However, there are many conditions that can cause compression of the tibial nerve. For example, fallen arches, spraining of an ankle or an abnormal mass near the nerve. A swelling caused by any injury or disease (such as arthrosis) can cause compression on the nerve and then lead to a tarsal tunnel syndrome as well. People with a tarsal tunnel syndrome may experience common symptoms like shooting pain, numbness, tingling or burning sensation along the service area of the compressed nerve (inner side of the foot and sole). The symptoms get usually enhanced by compression or tapping on the tarsal tunnel.","Name":"Tarsal tunnel syndrome","PossibleSymptoms":"Numbness in the leg,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Muscular weakness in the leg,Foot pain,Tingling","ProfName":"Posterior tibial neuralgia","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a tarsal tunnel syndrome include medication, assisting devices and in severe cases a surgery. Medication such as anti-inflammatory drugs or injections of steroids can relieve the inflammation and swelling. Assisting devices such as a brace or splint can avoid further damage to the affected nerve by limiting its movement. For severe cases, a surgery is necessary to release the nerve from pressure."}
