{"Description":"All newborns have a minor facial asymmetry  involving also their eyelids and most of these asymmetries disappear within a short period of time after birth. However, if a drooping lid at birth does not correct itself over time, it is called congenital ptosis. tt can develop in just one eyelid or both. The droop can block a part of the vision or even the entire vision for the affected eye. Without treatment, ptosis can cause amblyopia, particularly if the lid droops enough to reduce or block the vision.","DescriptionShort":"Congenital ptosis refers to a drooping upper eyelid which is present from infancy. If the condition is severe, a drooping eyelid may affect normal vision. When an infant is born with congenital ptosis, a doctor will evaluate if any treatment is necessary. If vision is not impaired and the eye can still be closed no therapy is needed.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of congenital ptosis is mainly due to the abnormal development of a levator muscle. The levator muscle helps to raise the upper eyelid and open the eye. Most of the time, congenital ptosis only happens to one eye. People with congenital ptosis may not fully open the affected eye and may have impaired vision.","Name":"Congenital eyelid levator weakness","PossibleSymptoms":"Drooping eyelid","ProfName":"Congenital ptosis","Synonyms":"Congenital eyelid drooping,Drooping of eyelid since birth","TreatmentDescription":"A ptosis is usually mild and vision will not be impaired which means no treatment will be required. However, it is recommended to have surgery early in order to correct the  condition if it is serious and impairs the vision. It is better to have the procedure performed when the infant is not less than three years old as the eyelid is then a little bigger. This makes it easier to work with it. In case of a severe droop which blocks the vision, a surgery can be required urgently for the baby to allow him to have a regular vision. If the ptosis triggers astigmatism or amblyopia, the affected person will need an ophthalmologist for treating it and for performing a restoration of the vision."}
