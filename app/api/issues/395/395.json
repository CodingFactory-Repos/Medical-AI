{"Description":"A squint, which is also called strabismus, is a condition when the visual axes deviate from a parallel position. Therefore affected persons are unable to focus one spot with both eyes at the same time. The causes include various dysfunctions in the coordination of the eye muscles and unilateral poor eyesight.","DescriptionShort":"A squint describes a condition when the eyes do not stand in a parallel manner and therefore cannot focus the same spot. It mainly results from poor control of the eye muscles, but could also be due to unilateral poor eyesight. A visit to an oculist is important in order to improve vision.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of a squint include: 1) damage or problems of the eye muscles, 2) damage or problems of the nerves which control the eye muscles, or 3) damage to an area of the brain which integrates the information to coordinate eye movement, caused, for example, by a stroke. 4) Poor sight on one eye that prevents the brain from getting an optical feedback about the actual position of the eye. In addition, a squint can also develop due to a congenital problem or general health conditions. People with a family history of a squint, refractive error such as farsightedness, and medical conditions such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, stroke and head injuries, may have a higher risk of developing a squint. A squint can be classified on basis of direction into four types: 1) inward turning: esotropia, 2) outward turning: exotropia, 3) upward turning: hypertropia, and 4) downward turning: hypotropia. Quite recently affected persons often suffer from double vision. After a while living with a squint, the patientâ€™s brain will suppress the information of the affected eye and therefore the affected person will barely notice anything. For children between 1 and 3 years of age, a squint is actually a dangerous condition. In this timeframe the visual area matures and a squint could lead to an irreversible and lifelong suppression of one eye (amblyopia).","Name":"Squint","PossibleSymptoms":"Double vision,Tears","ProfName":"Strabismus","Synonyms":"Squinting,Crossed eyes","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a squint can include: 1) Contact lenses and eyeglasses: it can help to adjust the vision for people with near- and farsightedness. 2) Prism lenses: it can adjust the angle of light entering the eyes and enables binocular vision despite squint. 3) Eye muscle surgery: it can correct the position or length of the eye muscles. 4) Covering the healthy eye of a child. This will force the brain to use the squinting eye and therefore prevent loss of eyesight (amblyopia)."}
