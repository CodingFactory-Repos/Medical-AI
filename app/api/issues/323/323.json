{"Description":"A mole (also called birthmark or nevus) refers to a pigmented, circumscribed benign malformation of the skin. If the malformation results from a proliferation of pigment cells (melanocytes), it is called melanocytic nevus. Depending on the location of the melanocytes, which arrange themselves in clusters or strings, moles can have different shapes, may be flat or raised. However, if the malformation merely results from a proliferation of melanin, the pigment produced by melanocytes, it will lead to freckles, Mongolian spots or aging spots, depending on the location. Those are called melanonical nevi.","DescriptionShort":"Mole is a medical term that characterizes a mucosa or abrasion of the skin that is chronic, circumscribed and visible. Moles are pigmented, small areas on the skin. The condition can be either acquired or congenital, this means that it can exist already since birth and is then called birthmark.","MedicalCondition":"The condition is caused by groups of cells that are visible in the skin. These cells that are pigmented are called melanocytes. It is not clear why these cells gather on the skin but research says that the clusters can be connected to localized defects of certain genes. It is not possible to prevent these cells to gather. Moles can have different appearances depending on skin types. Moles come with different colors including dark brown, yellow-brown or other different colors of human flesh. Moles can also be raised or flat. They can be warty, smooth or hairy. Most of time, the condition is harmless. However, in some cases, moles can get cancerous, triggering a possibly fatal tumor named malignant melanoma. This explains why it is important to check moles and visit a doctor or dermatologist regularly if moles get suddenly larger, their border becomes irregular, get inflamed or darker, shows some changes in their color, starts itching, cracking, or bleeding, or becomes painful.","Name":"Mole","PossibleSymptoms":"Irregular mole,Scar,Skin nodules,Skin thickening","ProfName":"Nevus","Synonyms":"Birthmark,Beauty mark,Beauty spot","TreatmentDescription":"A self-monitoring moles is important. As soon as an irregularity (asymmetry), a fuzzy boundary, a color change, an increasing growth, itching or bleeding is noticed, go as soon as you can to a dermatologist. It could be that a atypical mole is a malignant melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer type. It is particularly important to ensure adequate sun protection (sunscreen, long sleeves, caps or hats) and to get regular medical checks."}
