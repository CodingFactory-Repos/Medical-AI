{"Description":"Hypoglycemia means a symptomatic low blood sugar level. The body needs glucose to have enough energy. After the meal, the gut absorbs glucose and delivers it into the blood. If one eats more sugar than the body needs at that time, the pancreas releases insulin, which makes muscles and liver store the excessive part. When the blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone (glucagon) tells the liver to release glucose.","DescriptionShort":"Hypoglycemia, describes a condition characterized by an abnormal low level of blood sugar, which is the body’s main energy source. Causes of hypoglycemia are various. Consulting a specialist for a further investigation of the cause can help to avoid undergoing hypoglycemia.","MedicalCondition":"People with diabetes typically suffer from low blood sugar level. They will usually take medicine that increases insulin levels in the body. In diabetes patients factors like taking too much diabetes medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or excessive exercising are common causes that lead to a hypoglycemia. Besides, alcohol consumption, illness, insulin overproduction (due to a tumor), or other endocrine dysfunctions can lead to low blood sugar levels. Without enough glucose, the body cannot perform its normal function. Normally it is defined as hypoglycemia when the blood sugar level drops below 70 mg\/dl. The common symptoms include blurry vision, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, pale skin, headache, hunger, shaking, sweating, and finally even loss of consciousness. A big problem is that patients will feel these symptoms very late or misconstrue them and therefore be unable to consume some sugar before the loss of consciousness occurs.","Name":"Low blood sugar","PossibleSymptoms":"Cold sweats,Blackening of vision,Dizziness,Disorientation regarding time or place,Chills,Vomiting,Nausea,Impaired balance,Fast, deepened breathing,Physical inactivity,Difficulty to concentrate,Headache,Sweating,Anxiety,Nervousness,Vision impairment,Difficulty in speaking,Tremor at rest,Increased appetite,Tiredness,Feeling faint","ProfName":"Hypoglycaemia","Synonyms":"Low blood glucose","TreatmentDescription":"In acute phase the intake of glucose has highest priority. Either by consuming sugar containing drinks and food or, in case of lost consciousness, by an infusion. Further treatments of hypoglycemia depend on its causes. For example, if the medications caused hypoglycemia, then the doctor will adjust the dose. If one has a certain tumor such as pancreas tumor, it will be treated by surgical removal. If one has diabetes, the doctor’s prescription should be followed and the blood sugar should be checked regularly. If none of the causes apply, the lifestyle may be the cause for the hypoglycemia. In case of hypoglycemia consulting a doctor for a proper treatment way is recommended."}
