{"Description":"Atopic dermatitis (neurodermatitis) is a skin disorder that predominantly affects people with family history. In many cases these people also have hay fever allergies or allergic asthma. Atopic dermatitis is (see allergy) often associated with allergic reactions. It also causes a reaction to substances or stimulations that are generally harmless.","DescriptionShort":"Neurodermatitis (Atopic dermatitis) is a chronic inflammation of the skin in typical areas. It occurs when the skin becomes itchy with a patch appearing on the spot. The skin gets itchier with scratching and this cycle of scratch and itch makes the skin leathery and thick. The patient can develop numerous itchy spots, classically on the ankle, forearm, thigh, wrist, or neck.","MedicalCondition":"Atopic dermatitis often occurs during the first months of life, but may also develop only in schoolchildren or adults. Since the symptoms change with the patientâ€™s age, it is categorised in different stages. In infants it is called infantile eczema. The skin, especially on the head or the cheeks is reddened, oozing and itching. Scales and crusts occur. During childhood, the redness mainly occurs in the face, throat and neck, and is especially strong on the crook of the arm and the hollow of the knee, as well as the backs of hands and feet. The other skin is usually very dry. The often agonizing itching leads to children scratching a lot, and even waking up during the night because of the itches. Scratching causes tears of the inflammatorily changed skin, leading to additional inflammatory reactions. Eczema in adults affects mainly the forehead and eyelids, but also crooks of the arm, hollows of the knee and the backs of hands and feet. The skin becomes thicker and the lichenification is clearly visible.","Name":"Recurring itchy inflammation of the skin","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin rash,Skin thickening,Itching of skin,Flaking skin,Dry skin,Coarsening of the skin structure,Hardening of the skin","ProfName":"Neurodermatitis","Synonyms":"Chronic itchy inflammation of the skin,Allergic skin reaction","TreatmentDescription":"The most important component of treatment is prevention. Breastfeeding (at least 6 months, no feeding of porridge before 4 months of age) can prevent the onset of infantile atopic dermatitis. If no breastfeeding is possible, the baby should be fed with hypoallergenic milk products (commercially available). Important is also a very good skin care with moisturizing creams and bath additives. An avoidance of contact with substances to which you are allergic, is not always possible, but at least the reduction of contact should be sought. If symptoms continue, your doctor may prescribe ointments or tablets depending on the severity of case."}
