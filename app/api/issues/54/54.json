{"Description":"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that may be acute (short term) or chronic (long term). Frequent causes of hepatitis are viruses (such as the hepatitis virus), substances that do damage to the liver (alcohol, drugs, medications), fatty liver due to obesity, as well an uncontrolled response of the immune system (an autoimmune disease).","DescriptionShort":"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and can have different causes. Chronic inflammation of the liver can lead to permanent damage (liver cirrhosis). Patients usually experience general malaise and whites of the eyes (sclera) turning yellow.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of hepatitis normally gets along with the risk factors that people are exposed.

Hepatitis should be handled by a doctor, preferably by a specialist (gastroenterologist). The nature of treatment depends on the cause. Vaccinations for pathogens (hepatitis A and B) can be administered in those cases. Substances that damage the liver (alcohol, some medication) should be avoided if possible. In the case of a fatty liver, treatment consists of losing weight to prevent any possible forms of diabetes. In the case of an autoimmune-related inflammation, medications that suppress the immune system (such as cortisone) can be administered."}
