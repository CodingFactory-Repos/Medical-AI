{"Description":"Kidney failure is a condition where the kidney loses normal functions. It can be classified as either acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure develops rapidly but might be curable and reversible. Chronic kidney failure usually develops gradually over years and it is not reversible.","DescriptionShort":"A kidney failure is present when the kidney is severely damaged and can therefore no more fulfill its task. Depending on how rapidly it developed, it is classified as either acute or chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure occurs within hours or days and may be cured, but once it becomes chronic then it will most likely be permanent. People with chronic kidney failure therefore may need dialysis regularly or accept a kidney transplant.","MedicalCondition":"Kidney failure can be either acute or chronic. The causes of acute kidney failure are usually due to sudden damage to the kidney such as 1) a traumatic injury with high blood loss, 2) a sudden reduction in blood flow to the kidneys, 3) shock or sepsis, 4) obstruction of the urinary system, 5) damage from certain drugs or toxins, and 6) pregnancy complications. Chronic kidney failure develops gradually on the basis of certain disease. For example, the causes of chronic kidney failure include 1) immune system diseases such as HIV\/AIDS, hepatitis B or C, 2) urinary tract infection such as pyelonephritis, 3) chronic inflammation of the kidneys, 4) polycystic kidney disease, 5) congenital defects, 6) drugs and toxins, 7) diabetes and high blood pressure. People with kidney failure may have excessive accumulation of fluid in the body, and have symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, seizure, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and headache. It can also result in a loss of consciousness. Untreated, a kidney failure may lead to death.","Name":"Renal failure","PossibleSymptoms":"Urination during the night,Increased urine quantity,Increased thirst,Nausea,Leg swelling,Yellow colored skin","ProfName":"Renal insufficiency in men","Synonyms":"Kidney failure","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of kidney failure will depend on the conditions. An acute kidney failure will be treated according to the causes. For example, if it is caused by an infection, then antibiotics and a temporary dialysis can help the kidney to recover. However, if the kidney failure is chronic, the kidney will not gain back its function and the treatment may include substitutive procedures such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation."}
