{"Description":"The piriformis muscle is a muscle located in the lower back in the pelvic region. The Piriformis syndrome occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed and irritated between the piriformis muscle and the pelvic bone. It results in pain, tingling, numbness and even muscular weakness along the nerve and therefore affects the legs and feet.","DescriptionShort":"The piriformis syndrome describes an irritation of the sciatic nerve. This happens when the sciatic nerve gets compressed between the pelvic bone and the piriformis muscle. It can cause numbness, tingling, pain and even muscular weakness in the lower extremities. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroid are often used for the treatment.","MedicalCondition":"The piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve are both located in the lower back and both pass through the pelvis. When the piriformis muscle compresses the sciatic nerve, the sciatic nerve will be irritated and lead to the piriformis syndrome. There are many daily activities that can result in this problem. For example, improper sitting position (unilateral sitting, sitting with a wallet in the back pocket), sitting for a long time, improper use of muscles while doing exercise, lifting objects or climbing stairs. Also, traumatic injuries can cause piriformis syndrome, such as car accidents, falling from a great height, or any injury that can irritate the lower back. People with piriformis syndrome often feel pain, tingling, numbness or even muscular weakness along the sciatic nerve. These symptoms may affect the whole lower extremities. These symptoms look very similar to those of a herniated disc. The symptoms may become worse during walking, running or moving. Especially outward rotating and abduction of the leg in the pelvic joint can trigger the symptoms.","Name":"Irritation of the sciatic nerve","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain radiating to the leg,Limited mobility of the leg,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Lower-back pain,Hip pain,Physical inactivity,Leg pain","ProfName":"Piriformis syndrome","Synonyms":"Sciatic nerve compression","TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of piriformis syndrome include physical therapy and medication. Proper muscle stretching and massages can help to relieve the discomfort and prevent getting the syndrome again. However, medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs can improve the symptoms. A local corticosteroid injection is often used to relieve the pain effectively for a short period of time. In severe cases, surgery is recommended to decompress the nerve."}
