Only in severe cases, a surgery will be needed.","MedicalCondition":"Patellar luxation is a condition where the patella is out of its original position on top of the knee. It commonly slides outwards. There are many factors that can cause the condition. For example, a sudden change of movement, walking, running, doing sports and certain actions can put extra stress on the patella and dislocate it. Patellar luxation can also result from an accident, a direct trauma or impact on the knee. In most cases the patella will jump back in position right after it was dislocated. Therefore affected persons may only feel a sudden pain or even just an unpleasant feeling. Repetitive patellar dislocation is more common in young women. When the patella stays dislocated, people may have symptoms such as deformity of the knee, a bent knee, inability to move the knee, pain, swelling and tenderness of the affected knee.","Name":"Dislocation of kneecap","PossibleSymptoms":"Joint swelling,Knee pain,Knee deformity","ProfName":"Patellar luxation","Synonyms":"Trick knee,Floating kneecap,Dislocated kneecap","TreatmentDescription":"When a patellar luxation occurs, the affected person can try to straighten out his knee if possible.
