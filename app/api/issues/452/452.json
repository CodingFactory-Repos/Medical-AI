{"Description":"The facial nerve (nervus facialis) controls the movement of facial muscles. Once the facial nerve, its branches or nuclei are injured or damaged, the person is unable to control the facial muscles and suffer therefore from facial paralysis.","DescriptionShort":"A facial paralysis describes a condition when people cannot move their facial muscles voluntarily. It normally affects only one side of the face. The causes of facial paralysis are various. It is important to visit a neurologist in order to investigate the underlying cause and to get a proper treatment.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of a facial paralysis is mainly due to inflammation or injury of the facial nerves.  There are many factors that can result in the damage of facial nerves. For example: infections by bacteria and virus, damage caused during surgery, neurological diseases, facial traumas and fractures, and brain traumas. It can also be caused by damage to the nuclei of the facial nerve in the brain, for example due to a stroke. However there are plenty of possible causes, in the most common facial paralysis, the idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bellâ€™s palsy), one is unable to identify a specific cause. Additionally, facial paralysis can also be caused by a congenital problem, such as an abnormal development of facial nerves or muscles, compression of the facial nerve in the womb or some other genetic problem. People with facial paralysis cannot move the facial muscles voluntarily. Mostly only one side of the face is affected, which will render the face asymmetrical. Depending on the localization, disorders in taste and hearing could also occur.","Name":"Facial paralysis","PossibleSymptoms":"Problems with the sense of touch in the face,Facial paralysis,Dry eyes,Drooping eyelid,Tears","ProfName":"Facial nerve paralysis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of facial paralysis will depend on its cause. It is important to determine the underlying problem and, if possible, to treat it. However, the facial palsy can often not be treated specifically. Nevertheless it mostly improves or heals spontaneously. This spontaneous healing process will often need much time. Therapies such as physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy will help to rehabilitate the muscles and nerves directed and quicker. In severe cases, surgery will be necessary to improve the condition, for example to correct hanging eyelids."}
