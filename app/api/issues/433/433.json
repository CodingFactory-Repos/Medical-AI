{"Description":"Vasculitis is name given for the inflammation of certain blood vessels. Many conditions show through a vasculitis. Those conditions are differentiated depending on which parts of the vascular system, or which organs are affected. The Chapel-Hill-Classification describes vasculitides of the larger vessels (giant cell arteritis, Takayasu-arteritis), vasculitides of the medium vessels (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease), vasculitides of the smaller vessels (Wegener’s disease, Churg Strauss Syndrome, anti-GBM disease, Henoch–Schönlein purpura), vasculitides of variable size (Cogan Syndrome, Behcet's disease) and vasculitides of an organ (cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, primary CNS vasculitis). Vasculitis can also occur in combination with other systemic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid diseases or systemic Lupus erythematosus. Vasculitis might as well be caused by a hepatitis B or C infection, by medication or malignant diseases.","DescriptionShort":"Vasculitis describes an inflammation of certain blood vessels, caused by the immune system.
