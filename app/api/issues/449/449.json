Once there is damage on the surface of a tooth (enamel), bacteria can enter through the dentine into the center of the tooth (pulp). Eventually the infection inside the dental pulp will lead to the formation of pus. People with a tooth abscess may feel toothache and pain near the affected area. Furthermore swollen gingiva (gum), sensitivity to temperature, bad oral odor or even fever are common signs. If the infection gets worse, it may continue to spread to other parts of the body such as the jaw, the throat, the brain and the meninges.","Name":"Tooth abscess","PossibleSymptoms":"Face pain,Lip swelling,Mouth pain,Earache,Cheek swelling,Facial swelling,Headache,Swollen glands in the neck,Night sweats,Toothache,Pain when chewing","ProfName":"Dental abscess","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a tooth abscess aims to cure the infection and avoid further damage of the tooth.
