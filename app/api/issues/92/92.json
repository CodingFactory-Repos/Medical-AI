{"Description":"Deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot in a deep vein primarily in the legs or also the arms. This is a larger vein that runs through the muscles, in the case of the legs the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It is potentially dangerous, as the clot can cause swelling and pain in the leg or the arm and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism when it travels from the leg’s or arm's deep vein into the right atrium of the heart and then into the lungs, where it becomes lodged in the increasingly smaller blood vessels.","DescriptionShort":"Deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot in a deep vein in the legs or the arms, which could potentially reach the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.","MedicalCondition":"Anyone can develop deep vein thrombosis but it becomes more common over the age of 40. The causes of deep vein thrombosis are many: being inactive for long periods such as during a long journey, after an operation or during a pregnancy, clotting disorders, varicose veins, being heavily overweight, estrogen (birth control pills), and smoking. In some cases, there may be no typical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. If symptoms do occur, patients often notice a pain similar to that of sore muscles in the affected leg (usually your calf) or the arm, sensations of tension or weight, swelling, a warm sensation in the region of the clot and pain when pressed, and red skin. In the case of the leg the skin can be red particularly under the knee at the back of your leg. Deep vein thrombosis affects usually one leg, although not always. The pain may be worse when patients move the bodyweight from their foot upward towards their knee.","Name":"Clot in a vein","PossibleSymptoms":"Feeling of tension in the legs,Leg swelling,Pain in the calves,Marked veins,Blue colored skin,Foot swelling,Enlarged calf,Leg pain,Arm pain,Pain radiating to the arm","ProfName":"Deep vein thrombosis","Synonyms":"Blood clot within a deep vein,Clot in the leg vein,Clot in the arm vein","TreatmentDescription":"If symptoms present themselves after a long flight for example, a doctor or hospital should be sought out immediately. There you can be fitted with compression stockings to wear every day. These stockings will help prevent complications and improve your symptoms. The doctor may also prescribe blood thinners to prevent further clotting and to decrease the risk of a pulmonary embolism considerably. For those who travel long distances it’s recommended to stand up regularly and to move around or at least to do some calf exercises while sitting. Preventative therapy with short-term blood thinners is something that can be considered as well."}
