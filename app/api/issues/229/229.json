{"Description":"The endocardium is the inner lining of the heart valves and heart chambers, which is in direct contact with the blood. Endocarditis is an inflammation occurring in the endocardium. A bacterial infection is the most common cause of an endocarditis.","DescriptionShort":"Endocarditis is an inflammation of the endocardium. This inflammation can damage the structures and functions of the heart, especially those of the heart valves. It can be dangerous. The treatment often includes long-term antibiotic drugs. In severe cases, surgery can be considered.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of endocarditis is usually a bacterial infection. Pathogenic germs can enter the human circulation from every bodypart (mostly the mouth and skin) through the blood vessels. Once the germs arrive in the endocardium, it may result in inflammation and infection. Endocarditis can damage the normal structures and functions of the heart, especially those ones of the heart valves. Individuals with abnormal heart valves (sclerosis), previous surgery of the heart, history of endocarditis, and congenital heart problems will have a higher risk of getting endocarditis. Extraordinary common is an endocarditis in people with intravenous drug abuse. Besides bacterial infection, there are rarer autoimmune causes for an endocarditis such as rheumatic fever. Endocarditis gives rise to symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, fatigue, shortness of breath, skin rash, and even an excessive accumulation of fluid in the arms and legs. Typically are chronic light fever and loss of performance in early stages. An endocarditis is a severe disease due to the resulting damage on the heart and especially the heart valves.","Name":"Inflammation of the endocardium","PossibleSymptoms":"Bleeding in the conjunctiva of the eye,Fever,Pain in the limbs,Skin rash,Dark urine,Sweating,Joint pain,Changes in the nails,Palpitations,Skin nodules,Pallor,Cough,Weight loss,Chills,Leg swelling,Night sweats","ProfName":"Endocarditis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of endocarditis includes identification of the pathogenic germ, medication, and in some cases even surgery. After the pathogenic germ is confirmed, medication such as an antibiotic drug will be indicated. The treatment of antibiotic therapy may last for several weeks. Normally antibiotics will be given intravenously and orally. In severe cases, surgery may be needed to replace the affected heart valve. After an endocarditis patients are at high risk of developing another one and therefore need prophylactic antibiotic treatment before any surgical intervention (including dental clearance)."}
