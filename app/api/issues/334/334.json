And a benign bone tumor is named according to the original cell type, for example, osteoma starts from bone cells (osteoblasts), chondroma starts from cartilage cells (chondroblasts), and osteochondroma starts from both bone cells and cartilage cells. People with a benign bone tumor usually do not have obvious symptoms. However, a palpable mass can be the first sign of a benign tumor, and then pain may come later.
