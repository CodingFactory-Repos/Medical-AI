{"Description":"Increased intracranial pressure is a pressure on the brain meaning that the pressure inside the skull is above the normal range. The pressure can also mean that the tissue of the brain is swelling. This swelling can be caused by a disease such as meningitis or an injury in the brain. The condition can cause an injury to the brain. For a healthy adult, the normal measure of intracranial pressure is between 7 and 15 mmHg. When this measure reaches 20 to 25 mmHg, a treatment is required to reduce it.","DescriptionShort":"Increased intracranial pressure is a condition when the pressure inside the skull is higher than normal. It can be dangerous and cause serious problems. It usually results from brain injuries, and it can also lead to further brain damage. People with increased intracranial pressure usually require immediate medical treatment, and the medical team will try to solve the underlying causes.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of increased intracranial pressure include 1) a congestion of cerebrospinal fluid (liquor) in brain and spine, which results in a rise of pressure and the so called hydrocephalus 2) a rise of pressure in the brain, which results from brain tumors, aneurysm rupture and other subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain inflammation (encephalitis) and meningeal inflammation (meningitis), and stroke. 3) head traumas and injuries, which lead to bleeding in between the skull and the meninges (epidural and subdural hematoma). Increased intracranial pressure can be dangerous and cause serious problems. For example, people with increased intracranial pressure often have symptoms that may include behavior changes, consciousness changes or loss, pain in the head, lethargy, neurological deficiency (such as rigid pupil), seizure and vomiting. In patients with slowly increasing and chronic increased intracranial pressure symptoms like urinary incontinence, equilibrium disorders and dementia are observed.","Name":"Pressure on the brain","PossibleSymptoms":"Drowsiness,Disorientation regarding time or place,Impaired balance,Paralysis,Tiredness,Nausea,Involuntary movements,Headache,Blackening of vision,Fast, deepened breathing,Difficulty in speaking,Difficulty in finding words,Cramps,Vomiting,Unconsciousness, short,Neck pain","ProfName":"Increased intracranial pressure","Synonyms":"Increased pressure on the brain,Increased pressure inside the skull","TreatmentDescription":"Increased intracranial pressure needs an immediate medical treatment. People with increased intracranial pressure should be hospitalized in order to find the underlying health issue causing the problem. The treatments usually include: 1) breathing support, 2) lowering the pressure in the brain by draining fluid (liquor) from inside the skull, 3) medication to reduce the pain and decrease the pressure, and 4) in severe cases, temporarily removing part of the skull may be necessary."}
