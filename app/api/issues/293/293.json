{"Description":"An anal fold is usually a slack elevation around the anus that can occur singular or massed, and can vary in size. Sometimes, an anal fold can happen on the perimeter of the rectal area or right at the entrance. When an anal fold happens on the perimeter of the rectal area, it is called medically perianal fold. Such an anal fold is totally harmless when there is no interference with it. However, it can get inflamed in case of rupture due to any cause. A rupture of anal folds can happen when there is continuous friction with parts of clothing that can irritate the area. Sometimes, moisture can coat the folds and this can lead also to infection or inflammation. Anal skin folds are formed usually as a response of the body to cope with anal tears or fissures.","DescriptionShort":"A skin fold is essentially a tissue that bulges from the skin surface.
