For example, singers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, sales persons, and public speakers are among those who make great demands on their voices. This puts them at risk for developing voice problems. Besides, there are also some common situations that are associated with voice overuse such as: 1) speaking in noisy environment, 2) using cell phone or telephone excessively, 3) speaking with a pitch that is not appropriate, and 4) not using amplification when speaking in public. Our voice is produced by vibration of the vocal folds, which are two bands of smooth muscle tissue in the larynx. The larynx is located between the base of the tongue and the top of the trachea, which is the passageway to the lungs. Once we use an inappropriate way to speak for too long, it might increase vocal effort and lead to vocal fatigue, hoarseness, vocal cord lesions or hemorrhage and even laryngeal inflammation (laryngitis). If the vocal folds are overstrained for a long time (chronic), vocal fold nodules may occur and leading to permanent hoarseness, foreign body sensation and excessive hawking.","Name":"Voice overuse","PossibleSymptoms":"Hoarseness","ProfName":"Vocal fold lesion","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Here are some tips for keeping a healthy voice: 1) drinking water regularly, 2) no smoking, 3) not abusing or overusing the voice in an inappropriate way, 4) minimizing throat clearing, 5) moderating voice use when sick.
