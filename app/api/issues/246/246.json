{"Description":"Ganglion cysts are typically oval or round and are filled with a jellylike fluid called synovia. These cysts can develop also in the feet and ankles. The size can vary. Small ganglion cysts can have the size of a pea while larger ones can be about 2.5 centimeters in diameter. Their location can interfere sometimes with joint motion and they can be painful if they press on an adjacent nerve.","DescriptionShort":"A ganglion is a benign growth caused by a small eversion of the joint capsule or the tendons, usually of the hands. It is filled with synovial fluid (joint fluid). Ganglion cysts are lumps, which are noncancerous and develop most commonly along the joints or tendons of wrists or hands.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of ganglion cysts are not known exactly but some factors can increase the risk for ganglion cysts. While ganglion cysts can develop in anybody, they occur mostly in women starting at the age of 20 up to 40. People with osteoarthritis in the finger joints near to the nails of their fingers are most likely to develop the condition close to those joints. People who have injured their tendons or joints in the past have also a higher risk of developing ganglion cysts. A ganglion cyst is usually painless. The pain can occur when a cyst presses on a nerve but even small cysts can cause muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, or pain. Large ganglion cysts form noticeable lumps. Most people consult a doctor because of motion restriction and cosmetic issues.","Name":"Ganglion","PossibleSymptoms":"Limited mobility of the fingers,Joint pain,Joint swelling,Hand pain","ProfName":"Ganglion cyst","Synonyms":"Bible Cyst,Bible Bump","TreatmentDescription":"Since ganglion cysts are often painless, there is no need for treatment. Doctors can recommend a watch-and wait-strategy. In case of pain or interference with joint motion, the doctor can recommend immobilization since activity can cause the cyst to grow larger. Immobilization of the affected area can be done with a splint or brace for a short time to make the cyst shrink and to relieve pain. Doctors can also suggest aspiration or surgery if other approaches have failed. However, the cyst can recur even after surgery."}
