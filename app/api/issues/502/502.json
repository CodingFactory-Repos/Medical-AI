Familiar tremor is usually a dominant trait, if one of the parents carries the gene, then the son or daughter has a higher risk to have the tremor. However, affected parents are no necessity to suffer from an essential tremor. People with familial tremors may have trouble holding things. Emotional stress can increase the tremors as well. The specific symptoms include head nodding, shaking or quivering sound, problems with writing, drawing and drinking. It may occur when the person moves, which is called motion-related tremor, or when the persons gets older. In rest symptoms are slight. Sometimes it gets worse with stress and caffeine. Alcohol consumption typically lowers symptoms.","Name":"Familial tremor","PossibleSymptoms":"Tremor at rest,Physical inactivity","ProfName":"Essential tremor","Synonyms":"Shaky hand syndrome","TreatmentDescription":"Familial tremor normally does not need to be treated.
