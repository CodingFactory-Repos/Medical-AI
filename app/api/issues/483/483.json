{"Description":"A metabolic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by a metabolic disorder. A metabolic disorder can be any disease or condition that results in an abnormal level of metabolites in the body. The symptoms of a metabolic encephalopathy are normally acute. However, the brain dysfunction mostly is temporary, if treated in time, but may become permanent, if not.","DescriptionShort":"A metabolic encephalopathy is a dysfunction of the brain caused by a metabolic disorder. The symptoms of a metabolic encephalopathy start normally acute, and the damage can be temporary or permanent. The treatment involves urgent measures and the therapy of the underlying illness causing the metabolic disorder.","MedicalCondition":"A metabolic encephalopathy happens when the normal function of the brain is disturbed by an abnormal concentration of metabolites. A metabolic disorder leads to such abnormal levels of metabolites and therefore may result in some damages of brain cells, which then lead to a loss of their function. A metabolic encephalopathy can result from metabolic diseases such as imbalance of electrolytes (blood salts), hypothyroidism or other dysfunction of endocrine system, the end stage of kidney failure, severe liver diseases (cirrhosis) and many other diseases that can disrupt the normal metabolism. Besides, abuse of drugs and medications, or the toxicity of heavy metal can also result in an abnormal metabolism and lead to a brain dysfunction. The symptoms of a metabolic encephalopathy mostly occur acutely. People normally suffer from symptoms of impairment of consciousness like concentration disorders, delirium and loss of consciousness. However, this disease is reversible and curable as long as the treatment is early enough. If the damage cannot be repaired in time, then it may become a permanent damage and lead to a further diseases like dementia.","Name":"Brain damage caused by metabolic disorders","PossibleSymptoms":"Difficulty in finding words,Sleeplessness,Mood swings,Tiredness","ProfName":"Metabolic encephalopathy","Synonyms":"Toxic encephalopathy","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a metabolic encephalopathy will depend on the underlying problems. For example, if it is caused by an end stage of kidney failure, then the acute and long term treatment will be a regular hemodialysis. Medications are often used to control related symptoms, such as restlessness, sleeping disorder and somnolence caused by a metabolic encephalopathy. However, only when the underlying metabolic problem or disease is cured, the brain function can be totally improved. As long as there is any suspicious symptom happening, an immediate medical treatment is necessary to find out its cause and to prevent permanent damage."}
