{"Description":"Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis) describes a sign of worn in one (or more) joints, as a result of excessive degradation, beyond the usual wear that comes with age. Various causes lead to osteoarthritis, which are generally accompanied by damage to the cartilage. It subsequently leads to break down of the bone.","DescriptionShort":"Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that consists in a deterioration of the joints, not associated with old age. The patient suffers predominantly from pains when first starting to move or when the joints are tense.","MedicalCondition":"Excessive degradation of the joints is common among the elderly who are also overweight or have reduced bone matter (known as osteoporosis). People born with defective positioning of the joints or who have injured a joint in an accident are also likely to suffer from osteoarthritis. Itâ€™s estimated that about two out of three people over the age of 65 show signs of osteoarthritis, but not all are symptomatic. At first, osteoarthritis is felt as joint pain, causing loss of ability and often stiffness. Pain can be noticeable upon beginning of movements or during strenuous physical work.","Name":"Arthrosis","PossibleSymptoms":"Stress-related leg pain,Limited mobility of the leg,Limited mobility of the fingers,Immobilization,Joint redness,Joint pain,Joint swelling,Joint effusion,Hip pain,Neck pain,Back pain,Morning stiffness,Limited mobility of the back,Knee pain,Limited mobility of the ankle,Ankle swelling,Knee deformity,Finger deformity,Limited mobility of the hip,Difficulty with gait,Neck stiffness,Hand pain,Elbow pain,Finger swelling,Finger pain","ProfName":"Osteoarthritis","Synonyms":"OA,Degenerative arthritis,Degenerative joint disease,Osteoarthrosis","TreatmentDescription":"Advanced osteoarthritis can cause defective positioning of the joint as well as limitations to movement. Knees, hips, and fingers are all commonly affected. Therapy for osteoarthritis seeks to reduce pain and also to avoid any bone changes. Weight reduction in the case of obesity and regular, gentle exercises for the purpose of maintaining function in the joints are both important factors in treatment. If necessary, painkillers such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or local steroids may be prescribed. Additionally, substances that slow the process of damage to the cartilage may be incorporated into treatment. At the end stage of osteoarthritis, an operation to replace the affected joint with an artificial one often improves symptoms and quality of life."}
