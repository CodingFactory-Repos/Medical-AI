{"Description":"Presbycusis describes the process of the gradual, age-related, progressive hassle to hear, especially sounds with high frequency. Presbycusis most commonly occurs in both ears symmetrically, although not necessarily at the same time or speed rate. Since the loss of hearing is a gradual one, people with presbycusis may not realize directly that their hearing is diminishing.","DescriptionShort":"Hearing loss due to old age, which is also called presbycusis, is the gradual process of hearing loss occurring as people get older. It is a normal process, however if the affected person has a severe hearing loss and therefore limitations in daily living, then he should consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of presbycusis is the progressive degeneration of auditory cells in the inner ear, which are necessary for hearing. Several factors promote the development of presbycusis such as repeated exposure to loud sounds, music, or equipment during the life. Besides, hereditary (genetic) influences, diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure) und some medications are known to increase the risk for presbycusis. Common symptoms include symmetrical difficulty in hearing and a ringing (tinnitus) in the ears.","Name":"Hearing loss due to old age","PossibleSymptoms":"Impaired hearing,Trouble understanding speech,Ringing in the ear","ProfName":"Presbycusis","Synonyms":"Hearing loss in the elderly","TreatmentDescription":"Treatment is focused on improving daily hearing function, like using hearing aids, telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices. In severe cases speech reading (lip reading) and sign languages can also help. Sometimes a doctor will recommend a cochlear implant for those with nearly complete hearing loss, which is very uncommon for presbycusis. A surgery will be necessary to place an implant. An implant can help an almost deaf person with functional hearing nerve detect sounds again. With practice it can allow people to understand speech, but it does not restore the normal hearing."}
