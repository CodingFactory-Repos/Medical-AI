{"Description":"Constant and forceful rotating and flexing of hand- and elbow-joints leads to overstrain of the muscular system, especially in the attachment area of forearm muscles and on the outside of the elbow. The muscleâ€™s attachment area to the bones will be irritated and inflamed, also affecting the nearby structures (joint capsule).","DescriptionShort":"An epicondylitis radialis humeri describes a condition caused by constant overstrain of the elbow joint by rotation and flexion, that leads to pain in the attachment area of the muscles on the outside of the elbow. It is also commonly known as tennis elbow. Patients experience pain on the outside of the elbow. The area becomes sensitive to pressure. Rotating and flexing the hand becomes very painful and a powerful grip or also wringing out a towel to press out the water will not be or only constrained possible.","MedicalCondition":"Tennis elbow occurs when a muscle is overused and strained. The main cause is frequent contraction of the muscles located in the forearm. People use these muscles to lift and straighten their wrist and hand. The recurrent movements cause a stress to the tissue and this can trigger a sequence of small fissures in the tendons that connect the muscles of the forearm to the bony bulge at the external side of the elbow. Playing tennis, particularly recurrent usage of the backhand thrust with inadequate technique can also cause the condition. Other common movements of the arm are also among the causes. These movements include frequent use of the computer mouse, driving screws, cutting up meat or other ingredients for cooking, painting and using plumbing instruments. The pain connected with the condition may spread from the external side of the elbow into the wrist and forearm. Weakness and pain can make it hard to hold a cup, turn a door handle, grab an object or shake hands.","Name":"Tennis elbow","PossibleSymptoms":"Hand pain,Arm swelling,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Tingling,Elbow pain","ProfName":"Lateral epicondylitis","Synonyms":" ","TreatmentDescription":"Treatment includes medication (analgesics), physical measures (cryotherapy) and support, such as bandages. A temporary immobilisation can help reducing the inflammation around the elbow. If these treatments do not lead to an improvement of the condition, an operation might be necessary."}
