{"Description":"The condition \"tourette's syndrome\" was named after the revolutionary French neurologist, Dr. Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who was the first to describe the disorder in 1885. The initial symptoms of the condition are noticed typically in childhood, between three and nine years old. Gilles de la Tourette syndrome can happen in all people, no matter their ethnic groups. Men are affected more than women. In many cases, the patient shows less or symptoms of milder complexity like vocal tics or chronic motoric disturbances. Even if the disorder can be chronic with symptoms present during the entire life, the tic symptoms become worst for most patients in the beginning of their teen years. The symptoms improve at the end of their teen years but continue into their adulthood.","DescriptionShort":"Tourette’s syndrome is a neuro-psychological disorder that results from a faulty development of the central nervous system. People with the syndrome suffer from so called tics, which are unwanted repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). The syndrome usually starts from childhood. It is recommended to visit a neurologist if there is any related symptom.","MedicalCondition":"The exact cause of Tourette’s syndrome is somehow not clear at the moment. However, it is thought to be associated with a genetic problem that leads to an undesirable development of the motoric regulatory system in the brain. This genetic problem, which promotes the occurrence of tic disorders, can be inherited. As a result, there are aberrations in the brain of affected people leading to an overstimulation of motoric regulatory loops with the neurotransmitter dopamine, which then results in the execution of improper behaviors. Generally speaking, Tourette’s syndrome often starts from childhood, and happens to males more often than females. People with the syndrome will perform some repetitive and uncontrolled movements and sounds, which are called motor tics and vocal tics in medical terms. Blurting out some rude words or gestures unintentionally is just one of many forms of complex tics, which affects about 30% of the patients.","Name":"Tourette's syndrome","PossibleSymptoms":"Eye blinking,Tic","ProfName":"Gilles de la Tourette syndrome","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Tourette’s syndrome can neither be cured nor treated causatively. However, medication can still help to control the tic disorders. Frequently prescribed medications are psychiatric drugs such as neuroleptics, anticonvulsants or antidepressants, which all influence the neurotransmitters and therefore help to improve the symptoms. Besides medications, behavioral therapy and psychotherapy may help patients to live with the disease and to learn techniques to suppress their tics."}
