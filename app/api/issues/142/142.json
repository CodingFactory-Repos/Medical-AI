{"Description":"Patients with myopia are suffering from a defective vision, where far away objects cannot be perceived in focus. The visual perception happens in the retina, which is located inside the eyeball. To picture observed objects on the retina, the light entering the eyeball needs to break exactly on the level of the retina. The eye manages this refraction with support of the lens, which causes a stronger or a lighter refraction, depending on the distance of the object. Is the lens’ refraction too strong, or, to put it differently, the eyeball too long, far away objects cannot be perceived in focus anymore. This defective vision is called myopia.","DescriptionShort":"Myopia, known also as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is a condition that occurs when the light concentrates in front of the eye, rather on the retina. Patients perceive objects located far away to be unfocused and blurry, whereas nearby objects located close are seen sharply and normally. Lots of people suffer from shortsightedness.","MedicalCondition":"In case of myopia, the ball of the eye is relatively too long to concentrate the power of the lens and cornea of the eye. This causes rays of the light to come together not directly on the surface of the retina, but at a spot in front of it. The condition occurs also when the lens or cornea is too bent for the length or size of the eyeball. Myopia happens also in some cases when these two factors are combined. The condition starts typically in childhood and people with parents suffering from myopia are more likely to develop the condition. In most cases, myopia stabilizes at the beginning of adulthood but can progress sometimes with age. People with shortsightedness find it hard to see clearly distant objects and read correctly road signs. However, these people can read easily close writings and use computer. Other symptoms and signs of short-sightedness include headaches, squinting, and eye strain. When the condition is not corrected, the person can feel tired when playing sports or driving. It is important to consult a doctor or ophthalmologist if a person experiences these symptoms or signs while wearing contact lens or glasses.","Name":"Short-sightedness","PossibleSymptoms":"Vision impairment,Blurred vision,Vision impairment for far objects,Headache,Tears","ProfName":"Myopia","Synonyms":"Near-sightedness","TreatmentDescription":"The refractive power of the lens (as described above) in relation to the length of the eyeball can be corrected with glasses with dispersing lenses (“minus” glasses).  Besides that, there is the possibility of undergoing a laser operation in which the refractive power of the cornea, located in the lens, is reduced."}
