{"Description":"The eye is moved by three pairs of muscles and controlled by the oculomotor nerve (3rd), trochlear nerve (4th), and abducens nerve (6th) from the cranial nerves. These muscles move the eye up and down, right and left, and diagonally. Besides, the oculomotor nerve controls the eye lid and the pupil. When any of the nerves are damaged, the movements of eye will not function normally.","DescriptionShort":"Damage to the eye muscle nerves could prevent the affected person from normal functioning of eye movement. These damaged muscle nerves normally control the eye movements, the eye lid and the pupil. Whenever a person has the respective symptoms, a visit to an oculist is necessary.","MedicalCondition":"Causes and symptoms of damage to the eye muscle nerve can be various: 1.) Damage of 3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve): An often and serious cause is an aneurysm in an artery supplying the brain. It can also be caused by brain disorders, such as a head injury, a hemorrhage, a tumor, diabetes or high blood pressure. It leads to an outward squint, a hanging eye lid (ptosis) and wide pupil with reduced response to light. 2.) Damage of 4th cranial nerve (trochlear nerve): It is most often caused by a head injury. Other causes are diabetes, tumor, aneurysm, and multiple sclerosis. It will affect normal vertical eye movements and lead to double vision. Affected patients tend to tilt their head to the healthy side in order to compensate for the paralysis and to prevent this double vision. 3.) Damage of 6th cranial nerve (abducens nerve): It is the most common one. It can be caused by head injuries, high brain pressure, tumor, multiple sclerosis, aneurysm, brain or eye infections, bleeding within the brain, vasculitis and hypertension. It will prevent the eye from turning outward.","Name":"Damage to the eye muscle nerves","PossibleSymptoms":"Drooping eyelid","ProfName":"Paralytic ptosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of eye muscle nerve damages differs depending on the situation. Normally an oculist will use neurologic examination and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other examination to clarify what the causes are and which part of nerve is damaged, and then decide on the proper treatment. If necessary, a surgery could also be considered."}
