{"Description":"Dermatitis is a condition that makes the skin turn red and tender after being in contact with particular substances. In case of an allergy the immune system can be involved. The alternative cause is a damage of the protective skin layer which will allow the involved substance to irritate the skin. Some known substances include fragrances, soap and jewelry.","DescriptionShort":"People call it a rash but medically correct the disease should be called dermatitis. Either way, the skin gets tender and red after having touched something. An allergy or a damage of the protective layer of the skin can be the cause for it.","MedicalCondition":"If the cause of dermatitis is an allergy, it means that the immune system assumed that the body was under attack after touching some foreign material and it releases a set of chemicals that causes the allergic reaction which results in an itchy rash called contact dermatitis. Alternatively the irritant can also enter the skin through damages of the protective layer of the skin. Common triggers for contact dermatitis include fragrances in cosmetics, perfumes, lotions, shampoos, soaps, citrus fruit, particularly the peel, latex rubber, chemicals used in tanning leather, nickel found in belt buckles and jewelry, hair dyes or straighteners, poison sumac, poison oak, and poison ivy as well as certain medicine applied on the skin. The skin of the affected person can form blisters or it can form a raised red area with rash. This means that the skin will itch and probably show a burning feeling. Whenever something is damaging or irritating the skin, the affected person can immediately see the rash. However the rash can take one to two days to appear if its underlying cause is an allergy. Usually, symptoms of an allergic dermatitis show up exactly on the spot of the skin which was in contact with allergens (foreign substances) and it is more itchy than painful. Dermatitis from skin damage tends to be more painful than itchy.","Name":"Contact eczema","PossibleSymptoms":"Crusting,Dry skin,Flaking skin,Flaking skin on the head,Itching on head,Itching of skin,Skin rash,Skin redness,Skin wheal,Formation of blisters on a skin area,Coarsening of the skin structure,Skin thickening,Hardening of the skin","ProfName":"Contact dermatitis","Synonyms":"Allergic skin reaction","TreatmentDescription":"The affected person can treat the rash at home. As soon as the cause of the rash is identified (a foreign substance), it should not be touched again. A mild soap in combination with cold water should be used to wash the skin immediately if possible. This remove big parts of the substance and reduce the symptoms considerably. If the rash just appears on a small spot, hydrocortisone cream for relief can be used. The affected patient can apply moisturizers a multiple of times a day on the damaged skin to restore the protective layer. Also oral antihistamines can be used to relieve the itching. Unless a doctor suggests it, antihistamine lotion should be avoided since it can cause also an allergic reaction or skin irritation."}
