Acute bacterial meningitis is a serious condition that must be treated urgently with antibiotics, which are given intravenously, as well as corticosteroids to reduce the potential complications risk such as seizures and brain swelling as well as to ensure recovery. Doctors may recommend large-spectrum-covering antibiotics until they know the exact reason of the disease. Viral meningitis cannot be cured by antibiotics and most cases improve without treatment in several weeks. Usually, mild cases of the viral meningitis are treated by over-the-counter painkillers to help to relieve the affected person's aches throughout the body and to reduce the fever accompanied by plenty of fluids and bed rest. Doctors may prescribe an anticonvulsant drug so that the seizures can be better controlled and corticosteroids in order to reduce the swelling within the brain. Chronic meningitis is treated according to the underlying cause while antifungal medications are used to treat fungal meningitis when the cause is confirmed by a laboratory."}
