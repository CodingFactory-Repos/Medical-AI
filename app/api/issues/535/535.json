{"Description":"The deformity of the knee joints is a situation when people stand up straight, but the upper and lower leg are not in the same axis. This is either called bow-leg (genu varum, big gap between knees) or knock-knee (genu valgum; knees tight together). Infants and little children often have bow-legs due to the position in the womb and incomplete development of the bones. However, it can be caused by diseases, for example, Rickets and Blount’s disease.","DescriptionShort":"A deformity of knee joints is a situation when people stand up straight, but the axis of the upper and the lower leg still differ. It is thought to be normal for children under the age of 3 years. It is recommended to visit an orthopedist if the condition does not improve or leads to pain.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of this deformity are various. Most commonly the condition occurs with infants and little children. Bowlegs may happen due to the position in the womb and incomplete development of bones. Normally the condition will improve within 3 years after birth. If the condition is not becoming better, then the child is probably bowlegged. Besides, diseases can also cause the deformity of knee joints. For example, an abnormal bone development, fractures, Blount’s disease, poisoning of fluoride and lack of vitamin D (rickets) can cause the problem. A deformity of the knee results in an unilateral overstressing of the knee joint and in order of that to an increased abrasion of the cartilage, which leads to symptoms like knee pain and swelling. Besides, the overstressing promotes the development of arthrosis.","Name":"Deformity of the knee joint","PossibleSymptoms":"Knee pain,Knee deformity","ProfName":"Genu varum and valgum","Synonyms":"Bow-leggedness,Bandiness,Bandy-leg,Tibia varaknock-knee","TreatmentDescription":"Normally no treatment is needed for babies with bowlegs, unless the condition does not improve within 18 months to maximum 3 years of age. If the deformity of knee joints is caused by diseases, then the treatment will focus on the underlying problems. Normally, assisting devices such as special braces and orthopedic shoes can be used to adjust the deformity of the knee joints. For severe cases, a surgery might be necessary to adjust the axis of the leg."}
