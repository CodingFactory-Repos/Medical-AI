{"Description":"Aging process and strains change the structure of the Achilles‘ tendon. Fatty tissue can be stored in the tendons, or they calcify, so that in the event of sudden tension of the calf muscles they can’t transfer the strength to the bone anymore and rupture.","DescriptionShort":"Caused by the aging process, the Achilles‘ tendon can rupture with a bang upon being strained, e.g. beginning to walk or suddenly stopping from a run. The foot can’t be stretched, and standing on tiptoes is not possible anymore.","MedicalCondition":"When the Achilles‘ tendon ruptures, patients describe a painful bang similar to crushing wood, and a feeling as if somebody kicked their heel. A bruise and swelling will develop in the affected area. The foot can’t be stretched anymore without resistance, and standing on tiptoes is not possible.","Name":"Achilles tendon tear","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain in the calves,Muscular weakness in the leg,Limited mobility of the ankle,Enlarged calf","ProfName":"Achilles tendon rupture","Synonyms":"Achilles tendon tear,Tear of the achilles tendon","TreatmentDescription":"The typical accident mechanism and the symptoms are indications for the doctor. To confirm the diagnosis, an ultrasound or MRI will usually be done. Conservative and operative treatments can be considered, depending on whether the tendon is ruptured completely or partially. If the ultrasound shows a partial rupture, a special shoe or plaster cast that stretches the foot may be sufficient. Is the tendon ruptured completely, it has to be surgically sutured and will be immobilized with a special shoe afterwards."}
