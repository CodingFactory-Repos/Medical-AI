{"Description":"When a hip socket does not completely cover the ball part of the top thighbone, it is medically known as a hip dysplasia. The result is that the hip joint becomes completely or partially dislocated. Many people with the condition are born with it. If a hip dysplasia is identified in early childhood, the condition can be fixed with a soft brace. That is why doctors check babies for any indication of hip dysplasia shortly after birth and during well-child care visits.","DescriptionShort":"Hip dysplasia describes a disorder of the ossification of the hip joint in new-born babies. It is one of the most common disorders of bone structure development, affects more girls than boys and can be treated by various measures, if recognized early.
