{"Description":"Vestibular neuronitis is characterised by a suddenly appearing spinning sensation that will last for days. It is known that the symptoms are caused by a failure of the equilibrium organ, but the causes for such failure are still largely not understood. Causes are assumed to be a circulatory disorder, similar to an acute hearing loss (Neuropathia vestibularis), or a failure caused by an infection (Neuritis vestibularis).","DescriptionShort":"Vestibular neuronitis is an acute form of extreme dizziness, which is caused by a dysfunction or respectively failure of one of both of the organs in the inner ear that maintains balance. The symptoms associated with it are nausea and vomiting. If also the auditive inner part of the ear is being impacted, one would then talk about labyrinthitis.","MedicalCondition":"Suddenly appearing spinning sensations and nausea and vomiting are the main symptoms of vestibular neuronitis. They often increase when the patient is active, and decrease when the patient rests. Patients may also suffer from the tendency to fall down.","Name":"Vestibular failure","PossibleSymptoms":"Dizziness,Nausea,Vomiting","ProfName":"Vestibular neuronitis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"A diagnosis can be made after examining the equilibrium organs with special spectacles and tests. The therapy mainly depends on the symptoms. It can include anti-nausea medication or bed rest to prevent falls, and physioÂ­therapeutic balance training, after the nausea improves. Medication such as cortisone or blood circulation-promoting substances can be prescribed depending on the likely cause. The symptoms will usually disappear within a few days or a few weeks."}
