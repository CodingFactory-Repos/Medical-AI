{"Description":"An ankle joint injury can happen to any person independent of his age. However, men between fifteen and twenty-four years of age show higher risks to develop ankle injuries. In contrast women above thirty have higher risks than men. Around half of all ankle injuries happen during an athletic activity. While fractures involve bones and ligaments in the ankle, the affected person can also strain or tear a tendon.","DescriptionShort":"Ankle injuries are often associated with sport injuries but one does not need to be an athlete in order to twist and hurt it his ankle. Simple things such walking on a rough surface can cause a debilitating and painful sprain. The most often occuring ankle injuries are sprains fractures.","MedicalCondition":"An ankle injury occurs when the joint of the ankle is contorted too far out of its regular position. The condition develops mostly during activities related to sports. However the condition can develop even while walking on an irregular surface since such areas force the ankle and the foot into a position that is not natural. Another factor that may lead to the condition is the unusual position of the ankle when a person with loose-fitting clogs, sandals or high-heeled shoes walks. Other factors likely to trigger an ankle injury include rotating the ankle, rolling or contorting the ankle, an abrupt impact including during a car collision, landing after a jump in an uncomfortable position, and falling or slipping. The symptoms of a rupture or fracture and of a twist are very alike and comprise the inability to carry weight or walk on the damaged joint, swelling, bruising, often sudden and sharp pain. That explains why a person should immediately have a medical visit to have the injury assessed.","Name":"Ankle injury","PossibleSymptoms":"Foot pain,Ankle swelling,Blue spot on skin,Limited mobility of the ankle,Ankle deformity,Foot swelling,Enlarged calf,Joint instability,Joint pain","ProfName":"Ankle joint injury","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"If the injury affects only the ankleâ€™s ligaments, no surgery is necessary. A temporary immobilisation with a plaster-splint, elevation, local cryotherapy and decongestive medication can be applied. In most cases, a preventive blood thinning needs to be prescribed to prevent the risk of thrombosis that can be caused by the immobilisation. After six weeks, a stable ligament recovery can be assumed. If the ankle injury also causes a fracture of the lower leg bones, in most cases a surgery is necessary to stabilise with plates and screws. A long-term consequence, for example following a meniscus injury, is a higher risk of arthrosis."}
