A proper treatment can also help to control the symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"Lichen planus is a non-contagious inflammatory skin lesion. However, it is not known well which specific reason can cause this kind of inflammation. People with hepatitis C might have higher risks of getting lichen planus. Besides, certain medications may probably irritate the skin and lead to similar lesions (lichenoid lesions), for example antimalarial drugs, thiazides, ACE-Inhibitors and beta-blockers. People with lichen planus may show several papules on the body. The papules are often small, red, slightly raised, itchy and usually located at the skin of the trunk, the inner side of joints (wrist and knee) and extremities including arms, legs, neck, scalp, fingernails or toenails, and mucous membranes such as oral membrane and genitals.","Name":"Lichenoid lesion","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin nodules,Itching of skin,Hair loss,Changes in the nails,Skin redness,Blue colored skin","ProfName":"Lichen planus","Synonyms":"White spot disease","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of lichen planus aims to ease the symptoms and to inhibit the inflammation. It can be treated with steroid creams or oral anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids or retinoids. Another treatment option is the so called PUVA, which is a combination of the medication psoralen and ultraviolet light. Even with proper treatment the healing of lichen planus may take 9-18 months. Sometimes a local pigment disorder will stay after healing. If the lesions do not heal and become chronic, it is strongly advised to let it regularly check by a dermatologist, because it increases the local risk for skin cancer."}
