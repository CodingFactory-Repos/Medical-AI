{"Description":"A coccyx fistula is an unusual pocket occuring in the skin, that contains usually skin debris and hair. In the area around the coccyx, hairs will sometimes break and grow into the skin. A coccyx fistula is nearly always situated around the tailbone towards the top part of the buttock cleft. If a coccyx fistula becomes infected, an abscess will result and this is often extremely painful.","DescriptionShort":"A coccyx fistula (pilonidal cyst) describes an infection around the intergluteal cleft. It can be caused by ingrown or broken hairs and lead to strong pain. It occurs at the level of the coccyx and can lead to an infection with pus.","MedicalCondition":"Pilonidal cysts occur most commonly in men, particularly young ones, with a tendency for recurrence. People who spend extended periods of time in a sitting position including truck drivers are at higher risk of developing the condition. According to the opinion of many doctors, ingrown hairs trigger pilonidal cysts because it is frequent to find some hair follicles within the cyst. Pilonidal cyst is resulting into various symptoms including fever, pus formation, pain, redness and swelling at the base of the spine.","Name":"Coccyx fistula","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin redness,Wound,Lower-back pain","ProfName":"Pilonidal cyst","Synonyms":"Pilonidal sinus,JeepÂ´s disease","TreatmentDescription":"Good anal hygiene and thorough removal of the hairs around the intergluteal cleft can avoid an infection. If an infection occurs repeatedly, the pilonidal cyst should be removed surgically. The removal also has the advantage that the scar caused by the surgery is hairless, and the development of a new fistula is unlikely."}
