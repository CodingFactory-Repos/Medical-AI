{"Description":"Thoracic-outlet syndrome is a temporary or constant constriction of a bundle of blood vessels and nerves that run from the throat to the arms.  The result is a disruption of the circulation of blood and feeling and tactile sensation in the affected arm. Vessel channels and nerve paths overcome three physiological constrictions in their course. It may happen that muscular strain or variations in bone development cause those constrictions to become so tight, that vessels and nerves are exposed to chronic pressure. This can then lead to the symptoms described below.","DescriptionShort":"Thoracic-outlet syndrome or shoulder girdle compression syndrome is a rare condition involving damage or compression of the blood vessels and nerves that connect the armpit or arms to the neck. This compression can be present at birth or following some trauma around the area of the shoulder. The disorder can causes weakness and arm pain and can develop on one side or both sides depending on the cause.","MedicalCondition":"The first symptoms often occur in (young) adults. Persons who work often and heavily with their arms are more often affected than others. Typical initial symptoms include shoulder pain that radiates into the shoulder blade, the chest of the back of the head and that occur while carrying heavy weights. Eventually, numbness and tingling sensation in arms and hands will occur, even while resting, accompanied by feelings of heaviness and tension as well as rapid fatigue of the affected extremity. Prolonged pressure damage, especially of the nerves, can even cause paralysis. If blood vessels are affected, circulatory disturbances can result in marmorated or bluish extremities and a sensation of cold.","Name":"Shoulder girdle compression syndrome","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain radiating to the arm,Numbness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the arm,Limited mobility of the fingers,Hand pain,Absence of a pulse,Blue colored skin,Abdominal guarding,Numbness of the hands,Arm pain","ProfName":"Thoracic-outlet syndrome","Synonyms":"Shoulder girdle syndrome","TreatmentDescription":"Typical symptoms, different tests of blood circulation and neural supply, as well as x-rays or other imaging methods lead to the diagnosis of TOS. The therapy initially includes physiotherapeutic treatment. If the blood circulation or the nervous innervations are severely damaged, surgical therapy may be necessary to widen the causing constriction."}
