Therefore, it is recommended to visit a doctor if there are suspicious symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of pemphigus vulgaris is an abnormal autoimmune reaction, but the trigger is unknown. The misdirected autoimmune system may attack its own proteins with antibodies. In consequence of this the attacked skin layer may be separated and become inflamed. During the process of inflammation, fluid may start to accumulate under the skin or mucous membranes and then blisters may develop. The blisters are painful and tend to burst easily. There are three different types of pemphigus vulgaris: one affecting the mucosa, one affecting the skin and one affecting both mucosa and skin. The disease proceeds in episodes and reappears for long time (chronic). Besides, UV radiation, mechanical irritation (scratching) and certain kinds of medication such as penicillamine and ACE inhibitors can trigger the blisters.","Name":"Blistering disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Formation of blisters on a skin area,Mouth ulcers,Moist and softened skin","ProfName":"Pemphigus vulgaris","Synonyms":"Chronic blistering skin disease","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of pemphigus vulgaris will depend on the cause and severity.
