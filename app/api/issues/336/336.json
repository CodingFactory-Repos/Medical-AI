{"Description":"A bone tumor is a condition involving the growth of an abnormal lump or mass in a bone. The abnormal growing tissue may replace healthy tissue with the abnormal tissue. Eventually it may weaken the structure of the bones. A bone tumor can be benign or malignant. Malignant bone tumors can be classified either as primary or secondary.","DescriptionShort":"A bone tumor is abnormal cell or tissue growth in a bone. It can be either benign or malignant. The treatment of malignant bone tumors often includes surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of a benign bone tumor is unknown. Overgrowth of bones, the stimulation of inflammation, metabolic problems, congenital defects of bones, radiation and injury are possible causes. A malignant bone tumor can be categorized as either a primary or a secondary bone tumor. Primary bone tumors originate from bone cells (either conjunctive tissue or bone marrow tissue). The common primary bone tumors include chondrosarcoma, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and Ewingâ€™s sarcoma.  Secondary bone tumors are metastases, which means they originate from the other parts of the body, and the cause may be any kind of cancer that may spread the malignant cells to bones via blood vessels. Bone metastases are especially often seen in prostate and breast cancer. People with malignant bone tumors often have symptoms such as bone fracture, bone pain, and a palpable swollen mass. Besides, patients may suffer from general symptoms such as fever, loss of weight and excessive sweating at night.","Name":"Malignant bone tumor","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain in the bones,Back pain,Fever,Weight loss,Sweating,Arm swelling,Joint pain,Bone fracture,Leg swelling","ProfName":"Osteosarcoma","Synonyms":"Bone tumor malignant","TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of a malignant bone tumor will depend on the severity and type.
