This process gets promoted by poor oral hygiene, low amount of water in the body, smoking and some chronic inflammatory illnesses (such as sjogrenâ€™s syndrome). 3.) Non-infectious: tumors of the salivary gland, a trauma or radiation therapy in the oral area are other reasons for a sialadenitis. People with sialadenitis often have symptoms like abnormal tastes, decreased ability to open the mouth, dry mouth, fever, mouth or facial pain, redness near the affected area, and swelling of the face.","Name":"Salivary gland inflammation","PossibleSymptoms":"Mouth pain,Facial swelling,Swollen glands in the neck,Cheek swelling,Fever,Pain when chewing","ProfName":"Sialadenitis","Synonyms":"Sialoadenitis,Inflammation of a salivary gland,Salivary gland infection","TreatmentDescription":"Practicing a correct oral hygiene can help to avoid getting sialadenitis.
