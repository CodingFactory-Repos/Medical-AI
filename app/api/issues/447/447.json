It is necessary to consult an oculist as soon as possible when one experiences related symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"Keratitis is an inflammation occurring in the cornea. The causes of inflammation of the cornea can be either infections or be due to non-infections reasons. Infections are mainly caused by bacteria and get promoted by injuries on the cornea and carrying lenses for too long without pause. Besides viruses, such as herpes simplex, and fungi can also cause an infection of the cornea. Non-infectious causes are mainly foreign bodies that are stuck in the eye and therefore irritate the cornea, which will cause the inflammation. The common foreign bodies include contact lenses, dust, and dirt. Also eyelashes can mechanically irritate the cornea by reaching into the eye en scrubbing on the cornea. This is a common problem in people with an entropion. People with keratitis may feel pain, itchiness and tingling in the affected eye, while at the same time experiencing discharge. Furthermore, the cornea may blur and become rough, which will affect normal vision.","Name":"Inflammation of the cornea","PossibleSymptoms":"Eye redness,Oversensitivity to light,Feeling of foreign body in the eye,Burning eyes,Itching eyes,Tears,Eye blinking","ProfName":"Keratitis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of keratitis includes antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs as well as antibiotics.
