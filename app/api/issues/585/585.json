{"Description":"An autoimmune disease causes the immune system to produce antibodies against its own body structures because it doesnâ€™t recognise them as belonging to the body, but as extraneous. This leads to those structures being gradually destroyed. Antibodies can attack different body structures, causing an accordingly variety of resulting diseases and conditions. They are explained more detailed in the respective conditions.","DescriptionShort":"Autoimmune disease causes the immune-system to wrongly recognise body-structures as alien and to gradually destroy them. Because many different structures can be affected, various conditions can develop.","MedicalCondition":"As mentioned above, a variety of conditions with a similar variety of symptoms can occur, depending on the body structures that are wrongly attacked as extraneous. Common diseases resulting from an autoimmune disease are rheumatic conditions, some diseases of thyroid and kidney, multiple sclerosis, lupus and many more. They all have in common that they are chronic diseases that usually require lifelong therapy.","Name":"Autoimmune disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Fever,Pain in the limbs,Dry mouth,Joint pain,Chest tightness,Dry eyes,Skin rash,Swollen glands in the neck,Swollen glands in the armpit,Swollen glands in the groin,Mouth ulcers,Joint swelling,Problems with the sense of touch in the feet,Finger swelling,Finger pain","ProfName":"Autoimmune disorders","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"All autoimmune diseases are chronic and require lifelong therapy, to slow down the destruction of attacked structures and to maintain quality of life. In most cases therapy includes different medication that tries to influence the immune system to produce fewer antibodies against body-structures. As this therapy is not targeting a specific antibody, the immune-system will generally produce fewer antibodies, resulting in the patient being more susceptible to infections. Regular check-ups and therapy adjustments by a specialist for the respective conditions are important."}
