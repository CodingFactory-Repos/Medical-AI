{"Description":"Chickenpox is an infection by a varicella-zoster virus that commonly affects children and is highly contagious. In fact, the condition is so common in childhood that most of adult persons are immune to it because they have had it before. With some children there are only some spots but with others it can be possible to see their entire body covered with spots. The common areas affected include the legs and arms, especially beneath the arms, the belly and chest, scalp and ears, and the face. Children catch usually chickenpox in winter and spring, between March and May.","DescriptionShort":"Chickenpox is an infection caused by a varicella-zoster virus that is highly contagious. Most cases are in children below the age of 15. It spreads very easily from one person to another. The typical symptom of chicken pox is an itchy, uncomfortable rash. In adults the virus can become active again and lead to shingles.","MedicalCondition":"The highly contagious disease occurs primarily in children and can be seen as a skin rash over the entire body, with small, reddish, and itchy blisters. The risk of infection starts 1 to 2 days in advance to the appearance of blisters until the decrease of crusted wounds (usually 5 to 6 days after the rash has started). After the illness has run its course, the virus continues to reside within the body (inside certain nerve cells) and can become activated again later in life or in individuals with compromised immune systems. This infection is called shingles or herpes zoster and appears as a localized, very painful skin rash. The disease is contagious in people who have not yet had the varicella virus. In older people, pain may continue for several weeks or even months after the rash has disappeared. The disease usually runs its course without complications or consequences. Patients with pre-existing conditions such as neurodermatitis or weak immune systems may have a worse experience. Newborn babies are also greatly at risk of an infection. Chickenpox is considered a moderate disease when it occurs in children, but the affected skin areas can be extremely itchy and the child can have multiple symptoms ranging from fever, to feeling irritable even to feeling miserable.","Name":"Chickenpox","PossibleSymptoms":"Crusting,Earache,Fever,Formation of blisters on a skin area,Itching of skin,Pain radiating to the leg,Skin lesion,Skin rash,Scar,Wound","ProfName":"Varicella zoster virus infection","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Chickenpox doesn't have a particular treatment however medication can improve the symptoms. Mostly what happens is that the affected children's blisters start to crust up and then fall off by themselves within a timeframe of up to two weeks. A kid who has the disease should be kept away from public places so that the risk is reduced of infecting other persons who may not have had it. Itâ€™s also recommended that contact with pregnant women should be avoided, as an infection early on in the pregnancy or towards the birth can put the baby into serious health risks. Normally the treatment for chickenpox consists of medicine which reduces the urge to itch. Salves can also be used to dry out the blisters. With herpes zoster, anti-viral medication can be used to shorten the duration and intensity of the disease. A vaccine exists for children and youth against varicella and there is also a zoster vaccination for seniors over 60."}
