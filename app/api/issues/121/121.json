{"Description":"Glomerulonephritis describes an inflammation of the kidney structure, the so called glomerulus, based on various causes. It can be differentiated either in primary or secondary glomerulonephritis. The inflammation damages the glomerulus in a way that they canâ€™t function anymore, and the kidney function decreases further. The final stage is mandatory dialysis. It is possible that the course of the disease is much milder and without any symptoms, so that it may only be diagnosed by chance.","DescriptionShort":"Glomerulonephritis describes a number of conditions that all include an inflammation of the kidney structure (the glomerulus).
