{"Description":"A subconjunctival bleeding happens when small arteries on the conjunctiva tear and bleed, turning the white of the eye into red. The conjunctiva is unable to absorb the blood fast, so the blood is trapped beneath the transparent conjunctiva. It occurs spontaneously, mainly with elderly persons who are using blood-thinning medications or have high blood-pressure. However, sub-conjunctival bleeding is usually harmless and disappears within one or two weeks.","DescriptionShort":"A subconjunctival bleeding is a bleeding into the conjunctiva that usually appears spontaneously. In most cases it is harmless and heals by itself after some time. The affected person may not realize that he has a subconjunctival bleeding until he looks into the mirror and notices the white area of his eye being bright red.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of subconjunctival bleeding is not always known. However, some actions can cause a small blood vessel to rupture in the eye. These actions include vomiting, heavy lifting, powerful sneezing and violent coughing. In some cases, an eye injury can cause sub-conjunctival bleeding such as induced by rubbing the eye roughly, trauma from a foreign object injuring the eye, and a severe eye infection. The most obvious symptom of the condition is a bright red patch visible on the white of the eye. Even if a sub-conjunctival bleeding had a bloody appearance, the condition does not make changes in the affected person's vision, there is no pain and no discharge from the eye. The discomfort comes just from the scratchy sensation on the surface of the eye.","Name":"Subconjunctival bleeding","PossibleSymptoms":"Bleeding in the conjunctiva of the eye,Eye redness","ProfName":"Hyposphagma","Synonyms":"Sub-conjunctival bleeding,Broken blood vessel in the eye","TreatmentDescription":"Usually, a sub-conjunctival bleeding does not require treatment.
