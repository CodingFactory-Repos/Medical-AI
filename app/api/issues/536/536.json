{"Description":"Coxa vara is a kind of deformity in the hip joint. The normal angle between the neck and the shaft of a femur is about 120-135 degrees. And coxa vara is a condition when the angle is less than 120 degrees.","DescriptionShort":"Coxa vara (and its analogue coxa valga) is a deformity of the hip joint. It can be present since birth (congenital), develop during the process of growth (developmental) or caused by damages or diseases (acquired). An accessory appliance such as brace can help to adjust the position of hip joint. For severe cases, a surgery to place the femoral neck and shaft to a proper position can be necessary.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of coxa vara can be associated with a different growing rate between the neck and the shaft of a femur, an abnormal development of femur, or some damages or diseases that can affect the normal structure of bones. If the coxa vara is present at birth, it is called congenital coxa vara. Coxa vara can also appear after birth. Especially during the period of fast growing such as early childhood, which is called developmental coxa vara. Besides, acquired coxa vara is caused by some diseases or damages, which can break the structure of a femoral bone, for example, a femoral fracture, rickets, osteomyelitis or any disease that can affect normal bony structure. People with coxa vara may have a problem of inguinal pain, limping, different length of legs and limitation of movements.","Name":"Deformity of the hip joint","PossibleSymptoms":"Back pain,Hip pain,Limited mobility of the leg,Lower-back pain,Hip deformity,Limited mobility of the hip","ProfName":"Coxa vara and valga","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of coxa vara is to adjust the angle between the neck and the shaft of a femur into the normal range. If the coxa vara is mild, it can be improved by an accessory appliance like an orthesis. For several cases, only surgery is able to adjust the deformity. However, if the coxa vara is caused by an underlying problem, the specific problem should be treated at the same time as well."}
