{"Description":"Normally, the cells in a body age and die before they are replaced by new cells. A tumor disrupts this cycle as tumor cells grow, even if the body does not need them, and they do not die. The exact type of brain tumor will differ depending on where the tumor cells originate from and whether they are malignant or not. Primary brain tumors come from different cells of the brain as well as the central nervous system and are named for the kind of cell in which they form first.","DescriptionShort":"A brain tumor is an abnormal tissue growth inside the brain. This can prevent a human brain from normal functioning. The tumor can be benign or malignant, primary or secondary. It can cause various symptoms and is a serious medical problem that should be further checked by a specialist.","MedicalCondition":"Brain tumors originate when a normal cell begins to grow abnormally and eventually develops into a mass. The exact cause of abnormal growth is still unknown. Brain tumors can be classified into the following types: 1) Benign brain tumor: it is the least aggressive type of tumor and does not contain cancer cells. It has clear borders and does not spread to other tissue. 2) Malignant brain tumor: this tumor contains cancer cells and does not have clear borders. It can be life threatening because it can spread to other tissues and grow rapidly. 3) Primary brain tumor: it starts in cells of the brain and can spread to other parts of the brain, but rarely to other organs. 4) Secondary (Metastatic) brain tumor: this tumor originates from other parts of the human body and then spreads to the brain. People with brain tumors can experience various symptoms. It can cause a headache, visual disturbances, seizure, personality changes, poor coordination and gait, short-term memory loss, vomiting, lethargy and the like.","Name":"Brain tumor","PossibleSymptoms":"Double vision, acute-onset,Double vision,Facial paralysis,Headache,Impaired balance,Paralysis,Tiredness,Visual field loss,Vomiting,Trouble understanding speech,Difficulty in speaking,Hallucination,Forgetfulness,Feeling faint,Disorientation regarding time or place,Physical inactivity,Difficulty in finding words,Aggressiveness,Unconsciousness, short,Cramps,Mood swings,Problems with the sense of touch in the face,Nausea,Muscle weakness,Problems with the sense of touch in the feet,Difficulty with gait","ProfName":"Intracranial neoplasm","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatments of brain tumors depend on the cause, type, location and severity. Normally the supportive treatment includes drugs such as anti-seizure or antiepileptic drugs, steroids and sometimes surgery. Steroids decrease the swelling of the brain and antiepileptic drugs may help to prevent seizures. In addition, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are also commonly used to treat malignant brain tumors. If you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms without an explained cause, you should consult a specialist for further examinations and follow-up."}
