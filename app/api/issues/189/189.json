{"Description":"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is mostly localized in the legs and is the result of age-related, slowly-increasing hardening of the vessels. Other illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, increased blood lipid levels (cholesterol), and nicotine promote hardening of the vessels. In certain cases, the arteries can become clogged with blood clots, which can be caused by arrhythmia of the heart or abnormal vascular dilation. Supply to the tissue is reduced when vessels become clogged, which typically leads to effort related pain in the affected areas.","DescriptionShort":"Arteries are blood vessels that supply tissue with oxygen and nutrients. Arteries can become clogged due to wall hardening or due to formation of blood clots, both leading to reduced blood flow, therefore reduced amount of nutrients and oxygen will be given to surrounding tissues and the consequence will be cell death.","MedicalCondition":"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is especially common in older patients (affecting 3% of people over 60) and predominantly affects the legs. Slowly developing hardening of the vessels causes the patient to suffer from effort related, burning cramps and pains in the area below the blockage in the artery. Furthermore it can lead to cool and pale tissue (skin), rest pain when the affected body part is in an elevated position, venous ulcers (leg ulcers), and tissue death in the worst scenario. If blood clots are present, the symptoms mentioned above occur quite rapidly.","Name":"Peripheral artery disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Cold feet,Stress-related leg pain,Pain in the calves,Leg ulcer,Leg cramps,Non-healing skin wound,Hand pain,Foot pain,Impairment of male potency,Lower-back pain,Absence of a pulse,Blue colored skin,Leg pain","ProfName":"Peripheral artery occlusive disease","Synonyms":"Artery obstruction,Smokerâ€™s leg","TreatmentDescription":"In the worst cases, tissue death can occur.  In certain circumstances an amputation may be necessary. A work-up is usually carried out when typical symptoms occur and includes an accurate evaluation of the narrowness of the vessel using ultrasound and other methods. Treatment in the early stages may consist of walk therapy, blood thinning, and avoidance of triggers such as nicotine. In order to prevent the last stage of tissue death, sufficient supplies of blood need to be guaranteed. This can be done by means of catheter intervention in which the vessel is reopened with a balloon or by means of a bypass operation in which the narrow passage is by passed either by an artificial or natural vessel."}
