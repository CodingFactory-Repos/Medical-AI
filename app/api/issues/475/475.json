{"Description":"Eating disorders are a group of psychiatric problems, which manifest in harmful dietary habits. An eating disorder involves eating both too much or too little, abnormal eating habits, and other psychical symptoms.","DescriptionShort":"An eating disorder is an often seen and serious psychiatric problem. It causes the person to have either too much or too little intake of food. It occurs more often with women. Whenever there is any sign of an eating disorder, it is important to consult a psychiatrist before severe consequences occur.","MedicalCondition":"An eating disorder often begins in the presence of abnormal dietary habits. It is more likely to occur in women than in men. There are three main groups of eating disorders. The first one is anorexia nervosa: This is a condition when people, who have a critically low BMI (body mass index), deliberately do not want to take enough food. People with anorexia nervosa have a so called disturbance of body image, which means they feel fat although they actually may be too thin. A problem in patients with anorexia nervosa is the lack of insight for this illness. The second type of eating disorder is bulimia nervosa. This condition makes people, who generally eat few, suffer from massive attacks of food craving that will make them eat unusually large amounts of food. After the excessive intake of food, they may feel guilty and will try to lose the calories. Common methods are self-induced vomiting, laxatives and excessive sport. This behavior is called purging. Persons with bulimia may have normal body weight. The third type of eating disorder is called binge eating: This is a condition when people are tending to have attacks with out-of-control eating. Affected persons feel unable to control the urge to eat and may not even realize their behavior. People with binge eating disorders often have the problem of obesity.","Name":"Eating disorder","PossibleSymptoms":"Increased appetite,Cravings,Weight gain,Tiredness,Overweight,Distended abdomen,Vomiting,Underweight,Sensitivity to cold,Sadness,Nervousness,Nausea,Mood swings,Missed period,Joylessness,Hair loss,Flatulence,Feeling faint,Dry skin,Dizziness,Difficulty to concentrate,Changes in the nails,Brittleness of nails,Bold area among hair on the head,Bloated feeling in the stomach,Anxiety,Agitation,Weight loss","ProfName":"Psychogenic eating disorders","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatments for an eating disorder include the education of a healthy diet and nutrition, and avoidance of improper behavior such as purging.
