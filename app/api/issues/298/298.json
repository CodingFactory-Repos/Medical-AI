{"Description":"A meningioma is a tumor that forms mostly out of cells of the arachnoid layer just below the skull bone. The three membranes (arachnoid, pia mater and dura) that cover the brain and spinal cord just inside the skull are called meninges. One quarter of all central nervous tumors are meningiomas and they are mostly benign.","DescriptionShort":"A meningioma is a tumor occurring in the meninges. The cause is still not well-understood. Most meningiomas are benign and need no immediate treatment. Once treatment is required it often consists of surgical removal of the tumor with or without radiation therapy.","MedicalCondition":"The exact cause of a meningioma is unknown. Most occur sporadically and some happen in congenital disease like neurofibromatosis type 2. Research has shown that radiation therapy is a risk factor and that women in their fifties are more likely to get meningiomas than men. A person with a meningioma may have symptoms such headaches, seizures, blurred vision, weakness in arms or legs, numbness, speech problems.","Name":"Meningeal tumor","PossibleSymptoms":"Visual field loss,Facial paralysis,Impaired balance,Headache,Paralysis,Tiredness,Eye pain,Mood swings,Aggressiveness,Vision impairment","ProfName":"Meningeoma","Synonyms":"Meningeal tumour","TreatmentDescription":"If the meningioma does not cause any symptoms, then some doctors may suggest observation of the tumor for a while. If the tumor begins to grow rapidly and cause problems, then a surgery called a craniotomy may be performed to remove the tumor. If the surgery does not completely remove the tumor, then postoperative radiation therapy may be used to prevent it from returning."}
