It occurs due to pressure or traumatic rupture of the small vein near the anal area. Even though a perianal thrombosis looks a lot like a hemorrhoid, it shall not be confused with it, as the treatment is quite different.","DescriptionShort":"A perianal hematoma describes a collection of blood that is located under the surface of the skin at the edge of the anal opening. Usually it will heal by itself after a period of time. An analgesic may be used to relieve the pain, or a small surgery may be indicated in order to excise the perianal thrombosis and facilitate a speedy recovery.","MedicalCondition":"A perianal hematoma is usually caused by a traumatic rupture of a small blood vessel in the anal area due to increased pressure that results from straining. The causes of perianal hematoma include constipation, injuries while lifting heavy weights or riding a bike, working out often in the gym, severe coughing fits, surgery via the anal opening, trauma while introducing medical instruments, sitting for long periods of time, and pregnancy. A perianal hematoma manifests as a purple swellings on the edge of anus and it can either be soft (like fluid blood filled cavern) or hard (like a blood clot). Perianal thromboses vary in size from 2 till 8 cm. They cause pain which may vary from mild to severe range. Because of the pain, the patient is often unable to sit.

Conservative treatments like cold compresses and regular sitz-baths can help to reduce the swelling and pain. Patients can also use analgesics to relieve the pain. Ointments and topical cream are also recommended. Conservatively treated, a perianal thrombosis either resolves (as small ones often do) or drains due to a lesion in the perianal skin (as bigger ones often do). A doctor may suggest surgery to excise the perianal hematoma. If it is detected and excised within the first two days, the pain will be alleviated immediately and the healing process will be much speedier."}
