{"Description":"Dupuytren's contracture occurs as nodules and shrinkage in the area of the palm in consequence to a flexed position, especially the ring finger and the little finger. However, all other fingers can also be affected. Dupuytren's contracture has different degrees of severity, depending on how pronounced the diffraction or limitation of fingers extension is.","DescriptionShort":"Dupuytren’s contracture is a benign disorder characterized by a nodule formation and a fixed contracture of the palm area of the hand (due to a palmar fibromatosis), which leads to and increasing bending of the affected fingers towards the palm and to the inability to fully extend (straighten) them.","MedicalCondition":"The precise cause of the condition is not clear, but it is considered to have a genetic origin, as it occurs often in families. This means that if a person has the gene responsible of the disease, other factors including smoking, diabetes, and certain medicines such as the one to treat epilepsy, may trigger the condition. However, the role of these factors is unclear. Usually, the early symptom of the condition is the growth of minor bulges of tissue. These lumps are called nodules and appear on the palm of a person’s hand. The person may also feel tenderness around the palm of his hand with the skin becoming thick as well as with unusual depressions on the palm. Within months or years, various bands of contracted tissue named cords may occur within the hand. This will make it hard for the affected person to straighten his fingers as much as he was able to do. Dupuytren’s contracture can affect both hands and sometimes just one. As the condition progresses, it is possible for the fingers to be pulled permanently into a bent position. The affected person will find it hard to execute activities including swimming, shaking someone’s hand or using a guitar.","Name":"Dupuytren's contracture","PossibleSymptoms":"Limited mobility of the fingers,Hardening of the skin,Finger deformity","ProfName":"Dupuytren's disease","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Dupuytren's contracture is a benign condition that does not require mandatory treatment. If the loss of function of the hand through the flexed position and lack of stretchability of the fingers is too large, surgery is recommended, although is not a simple surgery, because in the affected area many vessels and nerves are present, the danger of injure of these structures is big. Numbness, restricted mobility, or reduced blood circulation are possible risks of an intervention. In addition, it is often that after a surgery a recurrence of the disease on adjacent fingers take place."}
