{"Description":"A lipoma is a commonly diagnosed growth of fatty tissue that usually occurs on several parts of the body. It is a benign tumor that starts in the fatty tissues. Many people have one or more lipomas. In most cases they don’t cause any symptoms, but if they grow big, or if a person has many lipomas, they can become a cosmetic issue and may impair the patient. If lipomas develop around blood vessels or nerves, they can cause pressure and lead to symptoms.","DescriptionShort":"Lipoma is a fatty, slow-growing lump that occurs usually between skin and its underlying layer consisting of muscle. A lipoma is not tender, feels doughy and moves readily with a minor pressure from the finger. Lipomas are detected usually in middle age.","MedicalCondition":"Lipomas can occur anywhere on and inside the body and their cause is unclear. They tend to run in families. This means that genetic factors play probably  a role in their occurrence. Numerous factors may increase the risk of developing a lipoma. These factors include having certain other disorders such as Gardner’s syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and adiposis dolorosa or being between 40 and 60 years old. Lipomas can occur at any age but they are most common in the group of the previously mentioned age range. Lipomas are very rare in children. Lipomas can develop anywhere in the body. They occur commonly in the thighs, arms, abdomen, back, shoulders, and neck. They are doughy swellings and soft to the touch and move easily when they are slightly pressed between a person's fingers. They usually don't cause any pain. Even though lipomas are generally small they can grow and become painful when they contain numerous blood vessels or press on close nerves. Some lipomas can be, less frequently, larger and deeper than classical lipomas.","Name":"Fatty tumor","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin thickening,Hardening of the skin,Bulging abdominal wall","ProfName":"Lipoma","Synonyms":"Benign tumor composed of adipose tissue,Fatty tumour","TreatmentDescription":"If lipomas are cosmetically irritating or impair the mobility of joints due to their location, they can be removed surgically.
