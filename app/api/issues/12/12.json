{"Description":"Atrial fibrillation is a temporary or lasting arrhythmia of the heart in which the atrial chambers of the heart can't pump optimally. This leads to heart chambers, which don’t fill enough and which caused the typical complaints.","DescriptionShort":"Atrial fibrillation is a trouble of the heart’s normal rhythm, whereby the atrium (of the heart) isn't able to pump optimally. Patients may experience heart palpitations and shortness of breath or even temporarily loss of consciousness.","MedicalCondition":"Atrial fibrillation may intermittently occur in healthy people and more often in patients with a known cardiac disorder. Atrial fibrillation often goes unnoticed in those with it. Still, palpitations, a racing heart, feelings of dizziness, shortness of breath, and even momentary unconsciousness may occur.","Name":"Irregular heart rhythm in atria","PossibleSymptoms":"Palpitations,Blackening of vision,Unconsciousness, short,Frequent urination,Tiredness,Shortness of breath,Dizziness,Chest pain,Anxiety,Irregular heartbeat,Feeling faint","ProfName":"Atrial fibrillation","Synonyms":"Irregular heart rhythm involving heart chambers","TreatmentDescription":"Occasionally a blood clot may form in the atrium, and leave the atria leading to a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Therefore patients are treated with blood-thinning drugs (mostly Marcoumar or Sintrom). The further treatment aims to keep the heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute, so that the heart can pump effectively. This may be attempted with medication, a pacemaker or a so-called cardioversion."}
