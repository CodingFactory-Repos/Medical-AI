{"Description":"Gray cataract is a disease of the eye. In contrast to the eye lens of a healthy person which is clear the person affected suffers from a misty or cloudy lens, which has become less clear over time that impacts the vision. Cataracts begin to develop sometimes with persons who are getting older and impacts their lens in a way that the light is being stopped to reach the back part of the eye, in specific the retina. This is where the \"seeing\" is happening, meaning that the optical images are converted into signals which then can be transmitted to our visual part of the brain. Cataracts become worse over the time and begin to affect vision. Surgery will be needed eventually to remove and replace the damaged lens.","DescriptionShort":"Gray cataract, also just simply called cataract, is a disease of the eye that leads to a slow clouding of the eye lens. Patients often complain of sensitivity to glare, a reduction in sharpness of vision, or cloudy vision.","MedicalCondition":"The disease usually occurs in advanced age and gradually progresses. The clouding of the lens first leads to disruptive sensitivity to light, especially to glare from backlighting at night time, and later leads to impaired sight. Many patients with cataract report cloudy or obscured vision.","Name":"Clouding of the eye lens","PossibleSymptoms":"Sensitivity to glare,Double vision,Halo,Impaired light-dark adaptation,Vision impairment,Blurred vision","ProfName":"Cataract","Synonyms":"Gray cataract,Grey cataract","TreatmentDescription":"If the clouded lense is not removed, blindness in the affected eye may occur. Treatment consists of a short operation by an ophthalmologist wherein the affected abnormal lense is replaced by an artificial lense. The operation is relatively low-risk and in the most optimal cases allows the patient an immediate improvement in their vision."}
