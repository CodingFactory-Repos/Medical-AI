{"Description":"A sprain of the ankle generally happens on the outside or lateral side of the ankle. Such sprains affect numerous people during various activities. A sprained ankle can also be associated with a fracture of the ankle. However, the sprain happens most commonly in isolation. There are people who are naturally predisposed to such a sprain. When a person has a hindfoot varus, the general posture or nature of his heels is turned a bit inward, this makes an ankle more prone for a sprain since it is easier for him to shift on his ankle.
