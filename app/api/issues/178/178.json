{"Description":"Inflammations of small glands around the anus tend to inflame over and over again. This leads to anal fistulas, narrow burrows and one or more openings in the skin. Anal fistulas are small channels connecting the skin close to the anus and the last part of the bowel. Anal fistulas are found usually among people who have a history of anal abscess. These fistulas occur when an anal abscess that is drained does not heal completely. Treatment is usually required in order to ease symptoms and minimize the chances of an infection within a fistula. Anal fistulas are categorized into various types based on their localization.","DescriptionShort":"An anal fistula is a small channel that develops between the skin close to the anus and the end of the bowel. Anal fistula is typically caused by an infection close to the anus, which is triggering a collection of pus in the nearby tissue. Once this pus drains away, a small channel is left behind.","MedicalCondition":"The opening of the fistula is visible from the outside near the anus. Often it drains liquid, in case of bigger fistulas even stool. Caused by the drainage of liquids from the fistula, the surrounding skin is often reddened and itching. If the ostium is blocked, it can cause swelling and abscess formation with sharp pain.","Name":"Inflammation in the anal region","PossibleSymptoms":"Blood in stool,Fever,Painful defecation,Skin redness,Pain of the anus,Itching of the anus","ProfName":"Anal fistula","Synonyms":"Fistula-in-ano","TreatmentDescription":"Often the doctor can diagnose an anal fistula by visual inspection, palpation and probing.
