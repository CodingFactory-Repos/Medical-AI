{"Description":"Spinal stenosis is a common condition that occurs when the small spinal canal containing the spinal cord and nerve roots becomes narrowed. This causes a compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots and leads thereby to an irritation of the contained nerves, which leads to pain, cramping, weakness or numbness.","DescriptionShort":"Spinal stenosis describes the narrowing of the space in the spine that results in pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots. People with the problem should consult a doctor either for medication to relieve the symptoms or surgery to improve the condition.","MedicalCondition":"A spinal stenosis is the result of several degenerative processes. The promoting factors are: 1.) Aging: Due to yearlong strain of the spine, the spinal disk loose volume and tend to build protrusions. Meanwhile the vertebral bodies tend to ossifications in form of bone spurs, so called spondylophytes, which also may narrow the spinal canal. 2.) Arthritis: chronic arthritis may cause spinal stenosis, such as spinal osteoarthritis (spondylarthropathy) and rheumatic arthritis. 3.) Spondylolisthesis: A condition with forward gliding of a vertebral body caused by spondylolysis. 4.) Inherited conditions: some people are born with a small spinal canal or a curved spine. 5.) Other causes such as tumors of the spine, injuries, Pagetâ€™s disease, too much fluoride in the body, and calcium deposits on the ligaments along the spine. People with spinal stenosis may have symptoms such as pain in the neck or back, numbness, weakness, cramping, pain in the arms or legs. Often the problem is located in the lower back and leads to pain in the upper legs while walking or standing, which typically relieve promptly when the legs are bent, such as in a sitting position. Alarming symptoms of a progressed stenosis are the loss of control of the bowel and bladder, and numbness in the inguinal and anal region.","Name":"Narrowing of spinal canals of the thoracic or lumbar spine","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain radiating to the leg,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Muscular weakness in the leg,Back pain,Stress-related leg pain,Lower-back pain,Limited mobility of the back,Physical inactivity","ProfName":"Thoracic or lumbar spinal stenosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of spinal stenosis includes medications to reduce swelling and reduce pain, infiltrations of the facet joints, physical therapy, and a brace for the back. If the symptoms do not improve or when serious symptoms occur like problems with walking, loss of bowel or bladder control or issues with the vegetative nervous system, then surgery will be considered or performed as an emergency respectively."}
