{"Description":"A stye results from the obstruction of a gland near the eyelid with subsequent infection. It may cause a pus-filled, red lump to form around the eyelid. A stye often forms on the outside part of the upper eyelid. However, it may sometimes form on the inner part of the eyelid. A stye looks similar to a chalazion, which is characterized as a non-infectious and mostly painless obstruction of a gland.","DescriptionShort":"A stye is an inflammatory lump on the eyelid that is caused by a bacterial infection of a gland. The reason for this infection is often an obstruction of a gland with subsequent infection. Sometime a sty will spontaneously heal, but sometimes it will need to be treated by antibiotics or a small surgical intervention.","MedicalCondition":"The underlying cause of a stye is often an obstruction of a gland near the eyelid. A lump near the eyelid due to obstruction of the gland without infection is classified as a chalazion. Besides, a stye forms mostly in sweat and sebaceous glands, while a chalazion is caused by the obstruction of a meibomian gland. However, stowed secretion provides ideal nutrients for bacteria. Once infected with bacteria, a gland becomes a growing inflammatory lump on the eyelid, which is classified as a stye. Behind this lump, there is a pus-filled cavity (abscess), which may drain from time to time. People with a stye may experience a red lump, mostly near the outside part of the upper eyelid, which may cause pain and sometimes swelling of the eyelid. Due to the obstruction of certain glands, dry eye symptoms may also occur in some cases. Untreated the abscess can spread on the whole eyelid, on the conjunctives or even behind the eye.","Name":"Stye","PossibleSymptoms":"Eyelid swelling,Eyelids sticking together,Eye pain","ProfName":"Hordeolum","Synonyms":"Sty","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a stye will depend on the condition. A small stye can heal by itself. However, medications such as antibiotics will help to eradicate bacteria. It is important to avoid squeezing the sties to prevent a further infection. In difficult cases, incision and drainage of pus may be considered."}
