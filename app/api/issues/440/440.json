    "Description": "Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden decrease of blood pressure caused by the effect of gravity. It normally happens during changing positions from lying or sitting to standing. During the changes of position, if the body is not able to regulate the blood pressure, it may result in lowering of blood pressure (hypotension) or even loss of consciousness (syncope).",
    "DescriptionShort": "Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden decrease of blood pressure due to the effect of gravity during change of position. Orthostatic hypotension is the result of various diseases affecting the ability for blood pressure regulation. It is recommended that the affected person consults a doctor to clarify the cause and get proper treatment if there is any related problem.",
    "MedicalCondition": "The causes of an orthostatic hypotension are various. However, there are some common factors including the following: 1) Dehydration may result in a loss of blood volume, and easily lead to orthostatic hypotension. 2) Heart problems will make it more difficult for the heart to suddenly increase cardiac output and therefore lead to hypotension, especially during changing of position. 3) Endocrine problems, such as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency, may, directly or due to damage on the nerves, disturb the regulation of blood pressure. 4) Nervous system diseases may also disrupt the normal regulation of blood pressure, as such count Parkinson’s disease, amyloidosis and dementia. 5) Some older people may experience orthostatic hypotension after eating meals due to the distribution of blood to digestive organs. Typical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are dizziness, impaired vision (“seeing stars”) and fainting (syncope).",
    "Name": "Fainting after standing up",
    "PossibleSymptoms": "Blackening of vision,Cold sweats,Unconsciousness, short,Feeling faint",
    "ProfName": "Orthostatic syncope",
    "Synonyms": "Passing out after standing up",
    "TreatmentDescription": "Avoiding a sudden change of position and raising slowly can prevent the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. The treatment of orthostatic hypotension will depend on the causes. For example, in the case where the cause of orthostatic syncope is dehydration, it is usually treated by the administration of fluids and electrolytes. If the orthostatic hypotension is caused by certain diseases, then the underlying disease should be resolved. Orthostatic hypotension can cause serious problems, especially in the elderly. Therefore, it is necessary to visit a doctor to find the cause and to undergo a proper treatment."
