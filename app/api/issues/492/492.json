{"Description":"Chronic pain mostly develops after an injury or an infection. Therefore in the beginning there is a morphologically detectable cause for pain. But the pain lasts for a long period of time, even longer than the underlying cause is detectable. So the pain evolves from a symptom to an independent disease, the so called chronic pain syndrome.","DescriptionShort":"A chronic pain syndrome describes an unpleasant painful feeling that is triggered by the nervous system and lasts for a long period of time. Many causes can result in chronic pain, but often there is no more physically detectable reason for pain at the time of diagnosis. After diagnosis, a proper medication for chronic pain can be indicated.","MedicalCondition":"A chronic pain syndrome can be defined as pain that lasts after the healing of an injury, and continues for 3-6 months or longer. The pain becomes an independent disease due to a lowering of the pain threshold on a neuronal level. The chronic pain syndrome can occur everywhere in the body and even in several areas at the same time. The pain can have a burning, sharp or electrifying character. The primary causes of such chronic pain can be an old injury, infection, headaches or migraines, back problems, whiplash, arthritis, cancers, fibromyalgia, nerve damage or previous surgery. Psychic disorders, such as a depression or anxiety disorder, may worsen or even cause the symptoms. At the same time, these psychic disorders can be the result of chronic pain.","Name":"Chronic pain disorder","PossibleSymptoms":"Back pain,Lower-back pain","ProfName":"Chronic pain syndrome","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of chronic pain is mainly to control the pain. It is important to clarify the cause of the chronic pain and to understand that it is not a symptom of any dangerous disease. This will make it easier for patients to control their pain. However, painkillers do not have the same effect on this form of pain, but it can control and relieve the discomfort somewhat. Therefore, a combination of painkillers, anticonvulsants and antidepressants are frequently used for chronic pain."}
