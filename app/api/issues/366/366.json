But as far as it is known, it is a disease resulting from the attack of the own immune system against the synovial, a structure of the joint. This can lead to an inflammation of every joint in the body. However, there is a typical pattern of distribution of joint inflammations. It is most commonly present in the base and middle joints of the fingers, the wrist, the base joint of the toes, the shoulder, knee and ankle. Besides genes, environmental factors, such as viruses and bacteria, are thought to play a role in causing rheumatoid arthritis. Most common the rheumatoid arthritis proceeds relapsing and chronic, which means it will never heal completely. However, some people have this disease for only a short time. The symptoms are swelling, pain, redness and stiffness in the joints. But sometimes it may also affects other organs such as the tendons, the bursae, the skin (rheumatoid nodule), the conjunctiva or even the heart and lungs. Severe forms of the disease can lead to total joint destruction. People with rheumatoid arthritis may also feel fatigued and sick. Sometimes they can develop light fever.","Name":"Rheumatism","PossibleSymptoms":"Joint pain,Joint swelling,Joint redness,Tiredness,Fever,Neck pain,Brittleness of nails,Morning stiffness,Skin nodules,Sweating,Muscle pain,Dry eyes,Finger deformity,Physical inactivity,Limited mobility of the leg,Toe swelling,Swollen glands in the armpit,Finger swelling,Finger pain","ProfName":"Rheumatoid arthritis","Synonyms":"Rheumatic disorder","TreatmentDescription":"The treatments are aimed at relieving the pain, reducing swelling, halting joint damage, and helping patients feel better and remain active.
