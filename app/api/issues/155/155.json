{"Description":"Retinal detachment is a detachment of the retina. Various mechanisms can cause the retina’s different layers to detach from each other, and things seen can’t be processed to the brain anymore. The most common form of retinal detachment is an existing hole in the retina, through which vitreal fluid finds its way between the layers and detaches them from each other. A hit or fall can also cause a bleeding between the layers of retina and detach them from each other.","DescriptionShort":"Retinal detachment describes a detachment of the retina caused by holes, bleedings or others. A retinal detachment should be treated by a doctor, as it may cause blindness of the affected eye.","MedicalCondition":"Retinal detachment may cause flashes of light and black spots that move with the viewing direction. Some patients may see a “rain of black dots”, if a blood vessel is torn and bleeding. A common symptom is also a shadow in the field of vision. Depending on the affected part of the retina, visual impairment and distorted vision may differ in their degree.","Name":"Detached retina","PossibleSymptoms":"Visual field loss,Vision impairment","ProfName":"Retinal detachment","Synonyms":"Retinal separation,Detachment of the retina","TreatmentDescription":"In most cases, a reflection of the ocular fundus can show a retinal detachment clearly. Treatment should be started immediately; otherwise the affected eye might go blind. For smaller detachments it might be sufficient to stick the retina together in their immediate environment, for bigger detachments, a more comprehensive surgery might be indicated. For more complicated retinal detachments, the removal of the vitreus body could become necessary. Generally, about 95% of retinal detachments can be treated without severe complications. Especially in case of spontaneous retinal detachments, the other eye might get affected after some time, an ophthalmologist regularly for check-ups."}
