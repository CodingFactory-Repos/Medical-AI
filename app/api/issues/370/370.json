{"Description":"The shoulder joint is a ball and socket type joint. The top part of the arm bone (humerus) forms a joint with the shoulder blade (scapula). The rotator cuff consists of 4 muscles and holds the head of the humerus centered into the articular area of scapula (glenoid). When one or more tendons of the shoulder joint are torn it is called a rotator cuff rupture.","DescriptionShort":"A rotator cuff rupture may be caused by a trauma or may be degenerative. Any tendon of the rotator cuff can be ruptured. A person with a rotator cuff rupture usually experiences pain and weakness in the shoulder. Resting the affected area and using anti-inflammation drugs may help to reduce the symptoms. In certain cases surgery will be required.","MedicalCondition":"The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons and muscles that converge around the shoulder joint at the top of the humerus. They form a cuff that both holds the shoulder centered and allows the arm to move in different directions. Causes of rotator cuff rupture include 1) injuries such as a fall on one’s arm while it is stretched out or a sudden jerking motion when one tries to lift something heavy, 2) a chronic tear of the rotator cuff tendon occurs slowly over time. It is more likely when one has chronically inflamed tendons or an impingement syndrome. Swimmers, tennis players and football players have higher risk of an acute rotator cuff rupture. People with rotator cuff rupture may have symptoms such pain, weakness and tenderness, difficulty moving, snapping or crackling sound in the shoulder. Often the pain occurs during overhead work or at night when sleeping on the affected shoulder.","Name":"Tendon tear in shoulder","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain radiating to the arm,Arm pain","ProfName":"Rotator cuff rupture","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Rest and physical therapy may help with a partial tear if one does not normally place a lot of demand on one’s shoulder. One can also ice the affected shoulder to reduce the pain and swelling. Medications such as anti-inflammation drugs or injections with corticosteroids may also help to reduce symptoms. Surgery should be done to repair the ruptured tendon if patients are young and have a fresh traumatic tear or if it occurs in elderly active people with healthy corresponding muscles. Surgical therapy is always based on the patients’ needs."}
