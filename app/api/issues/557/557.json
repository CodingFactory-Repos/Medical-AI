{"Description":"Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder belonging to the group of hypersomnia. It leads to an inability of the brain to regulate the sleep-wake cycles well. People with narcolepsy may have problems like excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy. The excessive daytime sleepiness can result in sudden sleep attacks, which may last from some seconds to minutes, even when persons had enough sleep during night. Narcolepsy can occur at any age.","DescriptionShort":"Narcolepsy describes a chronic neurological disorder leading to an inability of the brain to regulate sleep-wake cycles. The cause of narcolepsy is not well known. It is recommended to consult a neurologist, if respective symptoms appear.","MedicalCondition":"The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown. Some researches show that narcolepsy may be related to low levels of hypocretin (orexin), which is neurotransmitter in the brain. This may be the reason for the deregulation of the sleep-wake cycles. The low concentration of hypocretin is thought to be associated with a loss of brain cells that produce hypocretin due to some autoimmune reactions. Whether other factors such as vaccinations, a trauma or injury to the brain, tumors in the brain, stress, an irregular sleep schedule, and abuse of medications or any other damage to the brain can result in narcolepsy, is not finally proven. The common symptoms include extreme daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks despite sufficient amount of sleep), cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while retaining consciousness, triggered by a emotional stimulus such as joy or fright), hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations directly after awakening), as well as sleep paralysis (inability to move directly after awakening while fully conscious).","Name":"Extreme tendency to fall asleep","PossibleSymptoms":"Sleepiness with spontaneous falling asleep,Tiredness,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular weakness in the arm,Hallucination,Drowsiness","ProfName":"Narcolepsy","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Lifestyle changes, called sleep hygiene, can help to reduce the symptoms of narcolepsy, for example: 1) a regular sleep schedule, 2) keeping the bedroom dark during sleep, 3) avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, 4) not smoking, 5) doing something relaxing to fall asleep before bedtime, 6) regular exercise. Individually assessed strategies like daily sleeping episodes or the avoidance of certain situations will help to handle the disease. In addition, medications might be used for the treatment of narcolepsy, for example, 1) stimulant medicines, such as methylphenidate or modafenil, can help to stay awake during the day, 2) antidepressant medicines can help to reduce cataplexy, sleep paralysis and even hallucinations, 3) sodium oxybate can also help to control day time sleepiness and cataplexy. It is recommended to visit a neurologist if there are any respective symptoms."}
