{"Description":"Cervical spinal stenosis is a condition that occurs when the spinal canal, which contains the nerve roots and spinal cord, becomes too tight and therefore the spinal cord or nerve root is compressed. This compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots leads to pain, prickling, weakness or numbness.","DescriptionShort":"Cervical spinal stenosis is a narrowing of spaces in the cervical spine that results in pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots. People with the problem should visit a doctor either for medications to relieve the symptoms or surgery to improve the condition.","MedicalCondition":"Causes of cervical spinal stenosis include the following reasons: 1) Aging: As people get older, the aging process can cause a bulging of the discs, or a thickening of ligaments (ligamentum flavum). Aging can also lead to destruction of cartilage that cover bones and to excessive growth of the bones in joints. These conditions can narrow the spinal canal and cause spinal stenosis. 2) Inherited conditions: some people are born with a narrowed spinal canal. People with cervical spinal stenosis may have symptoms as pain, numbness and stiffness or weakness in the neck, shoulder, arms, hands or legs. Typically there is only one body side affected. Sometimes balance and coordination problems such as shuffling or tripping while walking, furthermore, if the cervical spinal cord is compressed, cervical spinal stenosis can make people paralyzed or incontinent.","Name":"Narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck","PossibleSymptoms":"Pain radiating to the arm,Neck pain,Numbness in the arm,Tingling,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Limited mobility of the fingers,Limited mobility of the back,Arm pain,Neck stiffness","ProfName":"Cervical spinal stenosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of cervical spinal stenosis can include conservative treatments like medications and exercises or modification of habits to move. Medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to relieve pain, exercise can help to strengthen the bones and muscles. Small spinal disc herniations can be treated without surgery, they often reform themselves. In many cases, a surgery to decompress the cervical stenosis affected area, and thereby reducing symptoms and the risk of permanent nerve damage, will be necessary."}
