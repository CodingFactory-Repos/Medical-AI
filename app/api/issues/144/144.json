{"Description":"Superficial mycosis is when the skin, mucous membranes, or nails are affected. If the fungus affects organs deeper in the body, then it is referred to as a systemic mycosis. Fungi that cause superficial mycosis are divided into three groups: dermatophytes, yeast, and molds. Molds usually only affect people with compromised immune systems. An infection by dermatophytes or yeast can occur in the context of diabetes or pregnancy. Yeasts colonize warm and moist areas of mucous membranes and skin folds. Skin folds, the mouth, genitals, and nail cuticles are susceptible to a fungal attack for this reason. Molds possess active components that can destroy callused human skin and eclusively attack the skin, hair, and nails. Fungi are found in soil, on animals, and can be transmitted between people.","DescriptionShort":"Mycosis is a fungal infection of animals and humans. Mycoses are common and its development can be assisted by a variety of physiological conditions. Mycoses start often on the skin (superficial) or in the lungs (systemic) and affect millions of people.","MedicalCondition":"Depending on the location of the fungal attack, the skin may show different signs of infection. A yeast infection manifests as a reddish, inflamed area of skin surrounded by flaking. A fungal infection of the mucous membranes in the mouth can produce a white film that can be wiped away, with a felty feeling as well as troubles to taste. A fungal infection on the genitals is accompanied by itching and discharge in women and itchy, white nodes and blisters in men. An infection by mold produces disc-shaped foci that have an elevated, reddened, and flaky margin. If the infection is located between the toes, then the skin is white and chapped. An infection of the scalp with hair presents either on the entire scalp or in several areas as redness with dry flaking and hair loss. An attack on the nails can happen via small injuries or from circulation disorders and manifests as yellowing and thickening of the nails.","Name":"Fungal infection","PossibleSymptoms":"Discoloration of nails,Changes in the nails,Skin rash,Skin redness,Itching of skin,Dry skin,Flaking skin on the head,Flaking skin,Itching on head,Bold area among hair on the head,Dry mouth,Mouth pain,Brittleness of nails,Itching or burning in the genital area","ProfName":"Mycosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The key for favorable results are early diagnosis, prompt use of appropriate antifungal treatment, and efforts to enhance the immune system. Antifungal drugs, usually creams, are prescribed to treat mycoses, except for example in the case of an infection of the nails and head. Most of the drugs are over-the-counter medicine. Some drugs can be administered intravenously for fungal infections that show resistance to other types of treatment. For fungal infections of the feet, keeping the feet dry is especially important to treatment."}
