{"Description":"Patients with bulimia suffer from binge eating, when they “can’t stop eating until everything is gone”, followed by feelings of guilt. Being afraid of weight gain, they will initially induce vomiting using their fingers; later on the vomiting will be reflective. Patients often have a pathological fear of gaining weight. People with bulimia often maintain a normal or slightly reduced weight above a body mass index value of 17.5. Body mass index (BMI) can be calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by body height squared. A normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to bulimia, people with anorexia (see the article on anorexia) have a BMI value under 17.5.","DescriptionShort":"Bulimia nervosa is a psychological disease that predominantly affects young women and shows a disturbed relationship with food intake. Affected people suffer from binge eating followed by vomiting. Instead of vomiting after binge eating, some patients might also misuse laxatives, do excessive exercise, or fast.","MedicalCondition":"Even though patients suffering from bulimia nervosa are often of normal weight, unlike those suffering from anorexia nervosa, they still show strong symptoms of malnutrition. Frequent vomiting leads to bad teeth, with tooth decay and other defects, and they also suffer from stomach complaints and heartburn. Malnutrition leads to problems with the bone metabolism and to reduced performance capacity.","Name":"Bulimia","PossibleSymptoms":"Vomiting,Cravings,Mood swings,Mouth ulcers,Cough,Dry mouth,Brittleness of nails,Menstruation disorder,Anxiety,Missed period,Weight loss,Heartburn,Weight gain","ProfName":"Bulimia nervosa","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Even if the affected person is not extremely underweight compared to anorexia nervosa, life-threatening disruptions, especially of blood salts can occur and need to be treated immediately. The long-term treatment should aim at building an almost normal relationship with food, body weight and body perception, by applying psychotherapy and other supporting therapies (e.g. ergo therapy). Treatment will be handled by a specialist."}
