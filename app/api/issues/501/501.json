{"Description":"Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum. There are two forms of peritonitis, which are differentiated as primary peritonitis and secondary peritonitis. When a systemic infection starting from the lymph nodes and blood develops itself towards the peritoneum, it is called primary peritonitis. This form of peritonitis is rare. Secondary peritonitis is the second and more common form of the condition. It occurs when the inflammation reaches the peritoneum from a perforation located in the wall of the abdomen. Primary and secondary peritonitis are both conditions to be taken serious and they can be the consequence of any rupture in the abdomen or a complication of an underlying medical condition. Without prompt treatment, these conditions can lead to death.","DescriptionShort":"Peritonitis describes an inflammation of the peritoneum that is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs. It is usually caused by an infection from bacteria. If peritonitis is left untreated, it could spread through blood to organs. It can be fatal. An immediate stationary treatment in the hospital is necessary.","MedicalCondition":"There are two main types of peritonitis: 1) Primary spontaneous peritonitis: it is an infection that starts in the peritoneum. The highest risk for it is water in the abdomen (ascites), which often develops in advanced liver diseases. 2) Secondary peritonitis: it develops when, due to an injury or infection in any abdominal organ, bacteria reach the abdominal cavity. The common risks include trauma to the abdomen and abdominal surgery. A very common cause of peritonitis is an appendicitis. A peritonitis is always a life-threatening condition. With peritonitis symptoms like fever, chills, excessive fatigue, less urination, nausea and vomiting, rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath may appear. Because the peritoneum is very sensitive, patients suffer from debilitating abdominal pain, which only remits in rest with cocked legs.","Name":"Inflammation of the peritoneum","PossibleSymptoms":"Rebound tenderness,Abdominal guarding,Abdominal pain,Fever,Nausea,Bloated feeling in the stomach,Vomiting,Reduced appetite","ProfName":"Peritonitis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment will depend on what is the cause of the specific peritonitis. The cause must be identified promptly. It is recommended to immediately start to treat the infection with intravenous antibiotics. Other treatments like intravenous fluids, drugs to maintain the blood pressure and nutritional support will depend on specific situation. Secondary peritonitis often needs surgery in order to remove the focus of bacterial infection."}
