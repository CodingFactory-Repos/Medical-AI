{"Description":"Alzheimer’s, disease, predominantly affects older people and is characterized by an advanced loss of brain cells and the resulting inability of the patient to demonstrate higher mental functions. People with Alzheimer’s disease have also a shortage of some major chemical messengers in their brain. These messengers help to transmit signals around the brain and when there is a shortage of them, the transmission of signals is not effective.","DescriptionShort":"Alzheimer’s disease, named after the doctor who first describes it (Alois Alzheimer), is a mental disease that affects the brain. This disease predominantly affects the elderly. Alzheimer is the most common form of dementia.","MedicalCondition":"Alzheimer’s disease does not usually begin before the age of 65 and affects more often women. A number of genes are known to reduce or increase the chances of a person to develop Alzheimer’s. Medical conditions such as obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, stroke, and diabetes in mid-life can increase the risk of both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. It is also important to treat depression early. A healthy lifestyle such as regular physical exercise, healthy balanced diet with a healthy weight, moderate drinking and not smoking can reduce the risk of developing the condition. Alzheimer’s is a progressive condition. This means that, over time, more parts of the brain are impaired and this leads to more symptoms that develop. These symptoms that are mild at the beginning can become more severe and interfere with daily life. Some symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are common but one has to keep in mind that everyone is unique. The condition will not be experienced exactly in the same way by two distinct people. For most patients, memory gaps are the first symptoms experienced. The affected person will commonly lose everyday items such as glasses and keys somewhere in the house or be unable to learn new information and remember recent events or conversations. He will have difficulties to find the suitable word, lose track of the date or day or become confused. Many people lose interest in hobbies and activities and become withdrawn. As the disease progresses, the patient is no longer able to carry out such everyday tasks as physical hygiene, getting dressed, or eating and drinking. Additionally, hallucinations, becoming easily irritated, Parkinson’s symptoms, or depression may accompany the disease. The disease can be especially tragic for friends and family who suddenly are no longer recognized by the patient as such.","Name":"Alzheimer type dementia","PossibleSymptoms":"Disorientation regarding time or place,Dry mouth,Forgetfulness,Memory gap,Difficulty in finding words,Tiredness,Headache,Difficulty to learn","ProfName":"Alzheimer's disease","Synonyms":"AD,Alzheimer disease,Alzheimer's","TreatmentDescription":"Unfortunately there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s yet that can cure it completely. There are medications that can alleviate some of the symptoms and allow the Alzheimer’s patient to remain independent and part of their surroundings for longer. It is beneficial for a person with Alzheimer’s to keep up with activities that they enjoy such as reading or solving puzzles, attending sessions that stimulate their minds and help with wellbeing, mood and memory."}
