{"Description":"The development of the stones is related to increased excretion of components forming stones such as phosphate, xanthine, cysteine, urate, oxalate, and calcium or to a decreased urine volume. Kidney stones are a common cause of pain in the groin, flank, or abdomen, and can cause blood in the urine. Kidney stones occur in 1 out of 20 persons during their lifetime. These stones vary considerably in size from small stones like gravel to big staghorn calculi.","DescriptionShort":"Urinary stones are stones formed in the renal pelvis as kidney stone and then become stuck in the urinary tract. Urinary stones can cause severe, cramping pain.","MedicalCondition":"When kidney stones reach the urinary tract and get stuck (where they are called urinary stones) they can produce severe cramping pain (called renal colic), which can radiate out from flanks to belly or groin. Movement of the stones along the urinary tract lead to small injuries of the mucus membrane in the urinary tract, which causes bleeding and can turn urine light pink.","Name":"Urinary tract stones","PossibleSymptoms":"Abdominal pain,Burning sensation when urinating,Vomiting,Urge to urinate,Chills,Nausea,Decreased urine stream,Side pain","ProfName":"Urolithiasis in men","Synonyms":"Urinary tract stones in men,Urinary stones in the urinary tract","TreatmentDescription":"Treatment consists of reducing pain with medication and observing the patient. Small urinary stones generally flow out on their own and can be “forced” out with the urine. Larger stones, however, need to be broken up with medication, shattered with sound waves, or removed with a ureteroscope. Removal is necessary, as kidney stones that clog up the ureter can cause urine stagnation, leading to infection in the upper urinary tract (see the article on pyelonephritis), which can damage the kidneys."}
