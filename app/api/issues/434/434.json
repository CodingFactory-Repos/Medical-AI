{"Description":"Palpitations are a clinical presentation more often in young women. It can be a symptom of harmless palpitations, for example caused by consuming coffee or tea, a harmless tachycardia (racing heartbeat), side effects of a medication (e.g. asthma medication such as Beta-2-Agonist), or non-organic conditions (e.g. panic disorders or somatisation disorder), or in rarer cases be caused by anaemia. A certain degree of stronger noticeable heartbeat is often harmless. For example lack of exercise or excitement can lead to a stronger perception of the heartbeat.","DescriptionShort":"Palpitation is the usually uncomfortable noticing of one’s heartbeat. The heartbeat is stronger (palpitations) and often too fast or irregular (skipped heartbeat). Palpitations may cause fear, but in most cases they are harmless. The heartbeat can be too fast, too slow, too strong or arrhythmic.","MedicalCondition":"Every person notices their own heartbeat every now and then; it can for example be a sign of excitement. However, some conditions can also lead to a noticeable heartbeat, e.g. heart conditions such as heart valve defects or excitation propagation disorders (cardiac arrhythmias). Circulatory system conditions, especially hypertension, but also lack of exercise can lead to palpitations. Diseases of the thyroid gland, especially hyperthyroidism leads to noticeable heartbeat as often as alcohol, various medications or psychological disorders (e.g. panic attacks).","Name":"Heart racing","PossibleSymptoms":"Palpitations,Feeling faint,Unconsciousness, short,Blackening of vision","ProfName":"Palpitations","Synonyms":"Palpitation","TreatmentDescription":"In most cases, noticing one’s heartbeat is harmless.
