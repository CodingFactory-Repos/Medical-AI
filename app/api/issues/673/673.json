{"Description":"A muscular dystrophy is generally caused by a hereditary disease, which leads to a progressive weakening of muscles. The typical forms of the muscle loss are the ones of the type Duchenne and Becker. Muscular dystrophy affects predominantly the muscles of the thigh, the pelvis and the shoulder. However also other muscles as an example the ones of the heart can be affected.","DescriptionShort":"Muscular dystrophy comprises of a group of illnesses of the muscles. These lead to muscle weakness and to a breakdown of the essential skeletal muscles. The disease can be diagnosed with help of a muscle biopsy.","MedicalCondition":"Muscular dystrophies are generally inherited and affect one in 5'000 primarily boys, in rare cases muscular dystrophies can also develop after a spontaneous mutation. Cause of the condition is the lack of proteins, which are necessary for the muscular metabolism. The gene defect mostly leads already at birth to a situation where these proteins are not available or only in a too low amount. With the two most common prevalent types Duchenne and Becker there is a lack of the dystrophin protein. It can usually be found in the muscle fiber membrane. When it lacks, it leads to a collapse of the muscle cell due to instabilities in the structure. This again leads to muscular weakness and ultimately to a muscle loss in the affected area.","Name":"Progressive muscle weakness","PossibleSymptoms":"Muscle weakness,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Tiredness,Muscle stiffness,Enlarged calf,Difficulty to learn,Difficulty with gait","ProfName":"Muscular dystrophy","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Besides a muscle loss it leads also to a deformation of bones and to deformities of the joints, which impair ordinary movements. For this reason, a suspicion for a muscular dystrophy diagnosis persists, when children show uncommon muscular weakness and problems with movement. A final diagnosis can be made in a first step with laboratory tests and ultimately with a muscle biopsy. In this particular case one can detect an increase of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood. Due to the muscle cell destruction it comes to a release of these enzymes, which occur in the skeletal and heart muscles. A muscle biopsy can provide the evidence with help of tissue removal from the affected muscles. A treatment targets to a relief of the symptoms and to a preservation of the important functions of the affected muscles as long as possible."}
