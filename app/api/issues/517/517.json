{"Description":"Periostitis affects typically people who lift heavy weights, run or jump repetitively. Repetitive stress on the shinbone, or tibia, causes shin splints. Periostitis improves often with rest but the condition can lead to chronic pain and discomfort. Infection of the bone can lead to acute periostitis that is a painful condition and can lead to necrosis, or death of the living tissue nearby the bone. Chronic periostitis can result from stress and trauma to the bones. An example of this condition is shin splints from running.","DescriptionShort":"Periostitis is inflammation of the periosteum, which is the connective tissue that covers and protects the bones.
