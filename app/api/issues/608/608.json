{"Description":"Excessive noise exposure means people have been overexposed to a situation full of noise, which not only prevents their normal hearing function, but also brings symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus and earache.","DescriptionShort":"When people experience a noise trauma or are exposed to a high noise level for a certain time, it can cause permanent negative effects on their hearing function. Therefore it is recommended to avoid exposure to excessive noise. If symptoms such as earache, tinnitus and loss of hearing occur, seeing an otolaryngologist is necessary.","MedicalCondition":"The ear consists of three main parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer ear is built by the auricle and the ear canal. The eardrum separates the outer from the middle ear. Small bones in the middle ear help transfer sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. Here, the vibrations become nerve impulses with the aid of sensory cells. These sensory cells can be damaged by overexposure to noise. Both, acute noise trauma and prolonged exposure to loud noise damage and destroy the sensory cells. As the number of sensory cells decreases, so does the hearing function. There is no way to restore the sensory cells, so the damage is permanent. The louder the noise and the longer someone is exposed to it, the more damage will be caused. The common symptoms of excessive noise exposure include: 1) hearing loss, 2) tinnitus, 3) anxiety and irritability, 4) pulse and blood pressure increase, 5) earache.","Name":"Excessive noise exposure","PossibleSymptoms":"Ringing in the ear,Impaired hearing","ProfName":"Excessive exposure to noise","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"To avoid excessive noise exposure, one should avoid staying in a noisy environment.
