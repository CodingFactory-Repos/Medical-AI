{"Description":"Inflammation of the veins is often caused by chronic stasis of the blood in pre-existing varicose veins in the legs or from an injury to the vein (from an infusion or shot). Phlebitis happens because there are clots of blood located in the vein or the walls of the vein are damaged. When the damaged vein is located close to the surface of the skin, the condition is called superficial phlebitis. Blood clots can also form in deeper veins such as the ones located in the legs and in varicose veins. When the blood clots occurs in the inflamed zone, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is a condition that can be life-threatening since it comes from blood clots located in deep veins.","DescriptionShort":"Veins are blood vessels that bring the blood back to the heart. Inflammation of superficial veins usually occurs due to pre-existing varicose veins or after injury to a vein (from an infusion or injection). A blood clot may also develop in the affected part of the vein while it is inflamed. Inflammation of the vein is most common in the legs, but is also (though less) likely to develop in the arms after an infusion treatment. Swelling occurs in the area around the infected vein and is red, warm, and painful.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of superficial phlebitis is often unclear. The condition can result from a medical procedure including the use of an intravenous catheter or line. Minor injuries caused to present varicose veins can also cause superficial phlebitis. Numerous factors can trigger deep vein thrombosis such as clotting disorders, damage to the inner lining of the vein, genetics, some forms of cancer, paralysis that makes the person inactive for a long period of time, prolonged inactivity including sitting for a long moment in a plane or car or lying for longer periods in bed following a surgery, and any condition that slows the blood stream. Symptoms vary depending on the inflammation site. Superficial phlebitis comes with symptoms including light fever, burning or itching in the inflamed area, swelling, tenderness, or warmth in affected zone, and redness along the canal of the vein. If the affected zone is lowered, such as the leg, specifically in the morning, this can worsen the symptoms. Superficial phlebitis is rarely serious but uncomfortable. In case of clotting, the affected vein feels cold or hard beneath the skin. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is often without symptoms. The rare symptoms include swelling, redness, and warmth in the inflamed zone. This form of phlebitis is dangerous since the clot of blood stuck in the vein can move and head to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain potentially able to cause death.","Name":"Inflammation of veins","PossibleSymptoms":"Feeling of tension in the legs,Marked veins,Hand swelling,Leg swelling,Increased touch sensitivity,Hand pain,Fever,Skin rash,Foot pain","ProfName":"Phlebitis","Synonyms":"Thrombophlebitis","TreatmentDescription":"Complications may arise, such as the movement or growth of blood clots from the superficial veins to deeper ones or the formation of pus-filled infection from bacteria. The patient should exercise the affected leg and support the inflamed vein with compression bandaging. If a large vein is affected or if the patient is bedridden, blood-thinning medication should be implemented."}
