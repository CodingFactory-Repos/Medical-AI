{"Description":"A mesothelioma is a tumor which occurs in the thin layer of tissue covering the majority of the internal organs. This thin layer of tissue is called the mesothelium. A mesothelioma is most common around the lungs, but can also occur in the heart and abdominal organs. Initially, it may be benign (not cancerous). Unfortunately the malignant (cancerous) version in the lungs is the most common one.","DescriptionShort":"A mesothelioma is a tumor occurring in the mesothelium. It can be malignant or benign. The causes of mesothelioma can vary. The treatments may include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. People with mesothelioma may have symptoms such as trouble with breathing, chest pain, painful swelling or lumps in the abdomen, fever and weight loss without obvious cause.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of mesothelioma include: 1) Working with asbestos: asbestos is a group of minerals made up of thin microscopic fibers. If the tiny asbestos fibers are released into the air, they can be inhaled or swallowed, which may lead to serious health problems. A long time (20-40 years) after exposition to a higher amount of asbestos a mesothelioma may develop. This is the most common cause of a pleural mesothelioma of the lung nowadays. 2) Radiation: some research has shown that exposure to high doses of radiation may lead to mesothelioma. 3) Genetic factors. Common symptoms of a mesothelioma are breathing issues such as shortness of breath, pain, coughing (even with bloody sputum), and pleural effusion. Besides, general symptoms such as mild fever, fatigue and loss of weight are also often found.","Name":"Pleural tumor","PossibleSymptoms":"Breathing-related pains,Shortness of breath,Bloody cough,Chest pain,Weight loss,Cough,Difficulty in swallowing","ProfName":"Pleural mesothelioma","Synonyms":"Pleural tumour","TreatmentDescription":"The treatments for mesothelioma may include radiation therapy, surgery and chemotherapy. Firstly, the surgeries indicated for mesothelioma may include a pleurectomy and decortication, extrapleural pneumonectomy, wide local excision and pleurodesis. Secondly, radiation therapy may be indicated which will destroy additional cancer cells and hopefully prevent recurrence. Lastly, chemotherapy with medications can further inhibit the growth of mesothelioma cells or even eradicate them."}
