{"Description":"A chalazion looks similar to a sty. The chalazion is caused by an obstruction of the meibomian gland. The gland is located in the eyelid and produces oily fluids to moisturize the eyes. If this meibomian gland is obstructed it will lead to an accumulation of secretion and thereby lead to a chalazion.","DescriptionShort":"A chalazion can be confused with a sty. It is a lump that can be caused by an obstruction of a gland in the eyelid. Sometimes a chalazion heals by itself, otherwise it will need treatment with hot compresses. For some cases, a surgery to remove the chalazion is necessary.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of a chalazion is an obstruction of the meibomian gland in the eyelid. The meibomian gland is located in the eyelid and produces oily fluids to moisturize the eyes and prevent the loss of water. People with a chalazion may experience an indolent red lump at the edge of the eyelid. Due to the obstruction of the meibomian glands, dry eyes may also occur. In contrast to the rather painful sty with bacterial infection, there is normally no pain and no bacterial infection in the chalazion.","Name":"Ulcer of the skin of the eyelid","PossibleSymptoms":"Eyelid swelling","ProfName":"Chalazion","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Sometimes a chalazion can heal by itself. Hot compresses can promote the healing by fluidizing the secretion and thereby improving the drainage. It is also important to avoid squeezing a chalazion as this can cause infections. If the chalazion does not improve or even gets worse after treatment, then a surgery may become necessary. In case of an infection antibiotic eye drops should be applied."}
