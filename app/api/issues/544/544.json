{"Description":"An iron storage disease (hemochromatosis) is an excessive accumulation of iron in the body. Iron is one of the necessary elements for human body, however, if there is excessive iron accumulating in the body, it may cause both temporary and permanent damage.","DescriptionShort":"An iron storage disease is a disease resulting from an excessive accumulation of iron in the body. The excessive iron can be stored in the liver or deposited in organs such as the heart, the pancreas, the joints, the spleen, the skin and others. Untreated, it can damage the affected organs.","MedicalCondition":"An iron storage disease often happens to organs such as the liver, the heart, the pancreas or joints. Depending on the causes and the type of the iron storage disease, it can be classified into three different varieties. Inherited iron storage disease (primary hemochromatosis) is a genetic disease, so people with a family history have higher risk of getting it. In this type a genetic mutation leads to excessive resorption of iron in the small intestine. The acquired iron storage disease (secondary hemochromatosis) is caused by other diseases or events such as hemolytic anemia, liver diseases and frequent blood transfusion. Lastly, iron storage disease of the newborn (neonatal hemochromatosis) is a rare version and leads often to a severe liver disease. Patients with an iron storage disease may have a great variety of symptoms due to the different organs involved. Most common are liver enlargement and damage, diabetes, skin color change and joint pain. Less common symptoms are spleen enlargement, rhythm disorder of the heart, fatigue and weakness.
