{"Description":"Varicose veins are a common condition, affecting up to three in ten adults. Women are more likely to develop the condition than men. Varicose veins are gnarled veins. Any vein in the body may become varicose, but the condition develops commonly in the feet and legs, especially in the calves. That is because standing upright and walking increases the pressure in the veins of the lower body parts. Varicose veins can lead sometimes to serious problems.","DescriptionShort":"Varicose veins are enlarged and swollen veins, usually dark purple or blue in color, which occur usually in the legs. They may be also twisted, bulging or lumpy in appearance. This disease can give an indication towards a higher risk for circulatory problems.","MedicalCondition":"Varicose veins affect roughly 15% of the population and women aged 30 and above are especially affected.  Patients usually notice their legs swelling in the evenings and sensations of tiredness, heaviness, or tension in their legs.  Walking and lying down alleviate symptoms, whereas standing and sitting aggravate them.","Name":"Enlarged and twisted veins","PossibleSymptoms":"Feeling of tension in the legs,Ankle swelling,Leg swelling,Marked veins,Leg cramps,Skin wheal,Leg pain","ProfName":"Varicose veins","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Superficial varicose veins can be treated with compression stockings or by a low-risk surgery.  If varicose veins remain untreated over a long period of time, it can result in chronic venous insufficiency, whereby the valves in the deep veins fail to close properly. Chronic venous insufficiency causes permanent swelling (edema), a hyperpigmented and itchy rash, a blue-ish coloration of the skin, and in the worst case, injuries that fail to heal (leg ulcers).  Itâ€™s important to seek out treatment for these problems early and consider some small procedures."}
