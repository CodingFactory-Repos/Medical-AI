{"Description":"Dacryocystitis may be chronic or acute. For acute infection, the area surrounding the nasolacrimal bag is swollen, red, and painful. The area around the eye may become watery and red and can leak pus. Dacryocystitis is caused by an infection of the nasolacrimal bag that leads to a blocking of the lacrimal drainage system. This condition can occur later in life or can be inherited.","DescriptionShort":"Dacrocystitis is an inflammation of the nasolacrimal bag which develops when tears cannot flow freely from the inner corner of the eye and is subsequently colonized with bacteria. This bacterial colonization caused by the impaired outflow leads to the inflammation.","MedicalCondition":"People with dacrocystitis suffer from pain, swelling, and redness in the corner of the eye up to the root of the nose. Pus is sometimes discharged from the nasolacrimal bag into the eye.","Name":"Lacrimal gland inflammation","PossibleSymptoms":"Tears,Eyelids sticking together,Face pain,Eye blinking","ProfName":"Dacrocystitis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Dacrocystitis can be treated with antibiotics and moist, disinfected compress. If the nasolacrimal sac is swollen to the point that an abscess could form, then it can be opened with a small incision and a drain can be inserted for several days. Since the tear duct remains clogged and closed after an episode of dacrocystitis, an operation should follow in order to reopen the tear duct and prevent future inflammation."}
