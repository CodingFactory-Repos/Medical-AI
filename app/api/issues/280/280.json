{"Description":"The spine’s usual form is supported by the interaction of bones, ligaments and muscles. If one part is weakened, or in the event of excessive strain, a malposition will initially occur. Long-term weakness or strain can then cause a deformity of the spine, called kyphosis. Kyphosis can affect single parts, or all parts of the spine.","DescriptionShort":"Kyphosis is an excessive bending or stretching of the vertebrae that leads to a hump (especially in the thoracic spine), a hollow back (in the lumbar spine) or to a flat back (straight spine).","MedicalCondition":"Kyphosis can occur in children and adolescents (Scheuermann's Disease), in adults (Bechterew's Disease or at old age (as part of an osteoporosis). All patients suffer from back pain. Depending on the kyphosis’ severity, it may also result in restricted movements. Especially children may suffer from social isolation by mobbing. Pronounced kyphosis, especially in the chest area can impair breathing, because the lung is unable to fully inflate when inhaling.","Name":"Hump","PossibleSymptoms":"Curvature of the spine,Back pain,Back deformity","ProfName":"Kyphosis","Synonyms":"Hunchback","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment depends on the type and cause of the kyphosis. It ranges from medication to physiotherapeutic exercises and usage of girdles to surgical corrections.
