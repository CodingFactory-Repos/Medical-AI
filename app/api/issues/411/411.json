{"Description":"Urinary incontinence is the inability to intentionally hold urine in the bladder. Bladder incontinence in women can result from birth giving, a weak pelvic floor, prolapse of the uterus, prolapse of the bladder or low estrogen levels. In men it can be caused by enlargement of the prostate or narrowing of the urethra. Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.","DescriptionShort":"Involuntary urination or urinary incontinence occurs when a person is unable to hold intentionally urine in the bladder and decide when he should empty the bladder. This condition affects a high number of people around the world and the gravity ranges from leaking occasionally urine when a person sneezes or coughs to having an urgent need to empty the bladder. This need is so strong and sudden that the person does not have time to reach a toilet.","MedicalCondition":"Bladder incontinence is a common condition in older women.  30% of women over 65 are affected by it. Stress incontinence can cause an unwanted need to urinate in the following situations: coughing, sneezing, straining, sex, lifting heavy items or other similar physical exercise. Urge incontinence presents with the occurrence of a sudden, intense urge to urinate even when the  bladder is mostly empty, which results in frequent urination with small amounts and occasional lower abdomen pains before urge to urinate develops.","Name":"Involuntary urination","PossibleSymptoms":"Frequent urination,Urination during the night,Itching or burning in the genital area,Burning sensation when urinating,Dribbling after urination","ProfName":"Urinary incontinence in men","Synonyms":"Incontinence","TreatmentDescription":"Pelvic Floor Exercise and behavior modification through regulation of the drinking quantity and toilet training can be an initial training in case of stress incontinence.
