{"Description":"Lymphatic vessels transport tissue fluids and dissolved substances towards the chest and lead it back into the blood vessel system shortly before reaching the heart. If lymphatic vessels are damaged by inflammations, tumors, operations, stowage or radiotherapy (secondary lymphedema), or if they are insufficiently developed by birth (primary lymphedema), the tissue fluids can’t be led away properly, and the tissue behind the damage swells (oedema). As an example, an armpit surgery (e.g. for breast cancer) can lead to an oedema of the arm.","DescriptionShort":"A lymphedema is a stowage of tissue fluid inside the subcutaneous fat tissue. Due to various causes the lymphatic vessels’ transport capacity can be exceeded, so that fluid remains inside the tissue.","MedicalCondition":"The manifestation of a lymphedema can be separated into 4 stages (0-3). Stage 0 shows an impaired transport capacity of the lymphatic vessels, but no swelling is visible. A so-called soft swelling, that can be pressed with the thumb and disappears very slowly, only develops during stage 1. Stages 0 and 1 can be cured completely with the adequate therapy. In stage 2, the constantly high pressure of the tissues leads to changes on and inside the skin (fibrosis). Unlike stage 1, stage 2 shows a hard swelling, it is difficult to press a dent into the oedema. Despite intensive therapy, the symptoms of this stage are only partly curable. Massive swellings develop in stage 3, which are called elephantiasis. The skin is rough and thickened. This stage is irreversible. Patients mainly complain about feelings of heaviness and tension of the affected body parts. If the oedema is located near the joints, limited mobility will be an additional symptom.","Name":"Lymphatic obstruction","PossibleSymptoms":"Leg swelling,Arm swelling,Limited mobility of the leg,Hand pain,Enlarged calf","ProfName":"Lymphedema","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"New lymphedema need to be examined to find out, if it is an actual lymphedema, or a swelling caused by a weakness of the venous system. The experienced doctor can do this with a diligent anamnesis interview and a physical examination. It is important to determine the causes of the lymphedema, because it will define the therapy. The main therapy includes manual lymphatic drainage, skincare, compression therapy with wraps or stockings, as well as decongestant movement therapy. The affected region of the body (e.g. a leg) should also be elevated. In some situations, surgery might be necessary."}
