This kind of cancer primarily appears in younger men between the ages of 20 to 40. It is a treatable and usually curable type of cancer. Treatments often include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.","MedicalCondition":"The exact causes of testicular cancer are still unknown. However, it is known that some conditions may increase the risk of having the cancer, such as 1) cryptorchism (undescended testicle), 2) testicular cancer in the family and 3) history of infertility. Testicular cancer mostly happens to men between 20 to 40 years old, but men at any age may have it. The two common types of testicular cancer are: 1) Seminoma: this type grows slowly and it is typically located only in the testes, however there is a risk that it may spread to the lymph nodes. 2) Non-seminoma: this type is more common than Seminoma and grows faster than seminoma. Symptoms for testicular cancer are usually an unpainful swelling of one of the testicles and sometimes some pain.","Name":"Testicular cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Swelling of the testicles,Cough,Bulging abdominal wall,Weight loss,Testicular pain,Shortness of breath","ProfName":"Testicular carcinoma","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatments of testicular cancer include the surgical removal of the testis affected with cancer as well as nearby lymph nodes. In Seminoma, radiation therapy is often prescribed after surgery to lower the recurrence rates, and in non-seminoma, chemotherapy is usually more successful. Before any therapy, the semen of the young patients is usually frozen in case they become infertile after the treatment. The majority of testicular cancers can be cured."}
