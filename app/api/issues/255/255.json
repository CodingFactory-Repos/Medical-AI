{"Description":"A hematoma (bruise) is caused by injury to the blood vessels, which then bleed into the surrounding tissue. Genetic diseases such as hemophilia, taking medication that thins the blood, and other blood clotting disorders can cause a large hematoma even with a minor injury. If a hematoma occurs in the skull, it is an emergency situation, as the leaking blood can put pressure on the brain.","DescriptionShort":"When blood leaks from vessels into tissue, it is referred to as a hematoma or a bruise. A hematoma happens due to a damage in the wall of a capillary, vein, artery, or blood vessel, which then leads to blood collecting outside of the vessel. This blood is then leaking into tissues where it doesn't belong, giving it a bluish color over time.","MedicalCondition":"A recent hematoma presents on the skin at first as a spot with a red-blue coloration. This abnormal coloration can change over the course of its presence, from blue, brown, green, and yellow, until it heals, usually after 2 weeks. Hematomas of the skin are painful when pressure is applied and may be slightly raised. If hematomas affect other organs, this can lead to a different set of symptoms depending on the location. A hematoma in the skull can cause consciousness issues, whereas a hematoma in a joint can cause joint pain.","Name":"Bruise","PossibleSymptoms":"Blue spot on skin,Cheek swelling,Lip swelling,Eyelid swelling,Ankle swelling,Hand swelling,Facial swelling,Leg swelling,Arm swelling,Headache,Lower-back pain,Back pain,Knee pain,Foot pain,Hand pain,Chest pain,Foot swelling,Arm pain,Elbow pain","ProfName":"Hematoma","Synonyms":"Collection of blood,Contusion","TreatmentDescription":"Hematomas of the soft tissues and skin are treated often with measures summarized as \"rest, ice, compression and elevation\" (RICE).
