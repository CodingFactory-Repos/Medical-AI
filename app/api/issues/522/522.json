The pain occurs in the area supplied by damaged nerves. Damage of the nerve can happen anywhere in the human body, however, the most common places include the face and neck.","DescriptionShort":"Neuralgia describes a shooting and shocking pain that develops due to damaged or irritated nerves and is located in the area supplied by the affected nerves. The treatment of neuralgia will focus on pain relief. When a person experiences similar problems as described here, it is important to visit a neurologist for further investigation.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of neuralgia is mainly due to nerve damage. The nerve fibers are protected by a myelin sheath. If the myelin sheath is damaged, it may result in nerve pain. Besides, also damage on the nerve fiber itself or circulatory disorders of a nerve can lead to neuralgia. There are many factors that can result in damage of the nerve, including 1) old age, 2) infection, 3) multiple sclerosis, 4) pressure on the nerves (for example herniated disks or carpal tunnel syndrome), 5) diabetes, 6) chronic renal disease, 7) porphyria, 8) trauma, 9) chemical irritation and the like. The most common neuralgias are the following: 1) Postherpetic neuralgia: it results from shingles and may be located anywhere over the body. 2) Trigeminal neuralgia: it is caused by damage of the trigeminal nerve, which goes from the brain to the face. 3) Glossopharyngeal neuralgia: damage of the glossopharyngeal nerve may produce pain in throat and neck.","Name":"Nerve pain","PossibleSymptoms":"Muscle pain,Problems with the sense of touch in the feet,Problems with the sense of touch in the face,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular weakness in the arm,Face pain,Sensitivity to cold","ProfName":"Neuralgia","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of neuralgia may include 1) surgery which can relieve the pressure on the nerve, 2) control of blood sugar, 3) physical therapy and 4) medications.
