{"Description":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes a progressive weakness in the muscles under voluntary control. It occurs when the immune system attacks the n-acetylcholine receptor, an essential structure in the communication between nerves and muscles.","DescriptionShort":"Myasthenia gravis describes an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder which disturbs the communication between the muscles and nerves. People with the disease suffer from a progressive weakness of their voluntary controlled muscles. Medication such as anticholinesterase agents and immunosuppressive drugs may help to reduce the symptoms. Sometimes surgery can be performed to control the disease.","MedicalCondition":"Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disorder that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In people with myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies that mistakenly block the muscle cells from receiving messages from the nerve cells. However, the exact cause of the misguidance of the immune system is unknown. Antibodies against the thymus, which often occur due to a tumor in the thymus, seem to play a role in certain cases. It may affect people at any age. It is more prevalent in women than in men. The main symptom of myasthenia gravis is weakness of all voluntary controlled muscles (the heart muscle and smooth muscle cells, which are located in a variety of inner organs, do not count as such). It therefore may lead to symptoms such as general loss of muscle strength, difficulty with breathing, chewing, talking, swallowing, further a drooping head, facial paralysis, fatigue, and hoarseness. At early stage the disease typically causes first trouble with the eye muscles such as double vision and drooping of the eyelids.","Name":"Myasthenia gravis","PossibleSymptoms":"Difficulty in swallowing,Drooping eyelid,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Physical inactivity","ProfName":"Pseudoparalytic myasthenia gravis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"There is no complete cure for Myasthenia gravis. However, proper medical treatment can help to reduce associated symptoms. Some doctors suggest changes in lifestyle, for example having adequate rest and avoiding stress and heat exposure which can worsen the symptoms. Medication is often used to relieve symptoms. For example, anticholinesterase agents like pyridostigmine or neostigmine may improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength. Immunosuppressive drugs like prednisone, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and tacrolimus can be used to suppress the production of abnormal antibodies. In some cases a surgical removal of the thymus can change the process for the better."}
