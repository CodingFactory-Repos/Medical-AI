{"Description":"Strain of the neck muscle refers to damage or overstretch of a neck muscle or its attaching tendons. People can strain the neck muscles by putting undue pressure on the neck, improper position or other daily activities.","DescriptionShort":"Strain of the neck muscles happens when the neck muscle is over-stretched, -stressed or torn. It usually takes some weeks to heal. It is recommended to follow the principles of RICE (rest, icing, compression and elevation) when strain of the neck muscle happens and to avoid overusing the affected muscles. Medications like painkiller can also relieve the symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"Strain of the neck muscles can be caused by: 1) Improper postures, such as being hunched over to read or to use a computer, 2) Improper position during sleep, such as sleeping on a pillow that is too high or too hard. In this situation, the neck has to stretch and maintain the same posture, and strain may happen. 3) Carrying or lifting heavy things on the shoulders, which can cause overstretch of the neck muscles. 4) Traumas and injuries, which can damage or over-stretch the neck muscles, such as a fall from a height, sport accident or a car accident. Due to the initial damage on the muscles, nerve fibers are irritated and via a reflex arc this leads to a further increased contraction of the muscle. This circuit is the reason why a strain of the neck muscles takes a longer time to heal than the often little damage would let expect.","Name":"Strain of the neck muscles","PossibleSymptoms":"Neck pain,Pain radiating to the arm,Neck stiffness,Morning stiffness","ProfName":"Muscle tightness in neck","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Once the strain happens to the neck muscles, it is recommended to follow the principles of RICE, which means to rest, to ice, to compress and to elevate. Meanwhile, pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication, muscle relaxants can also help to relieve the symptoms and give a breakthrough in the vicious circle. Massage can help the blood flow to the neck muscle and loosen the tight muscles. Heat therapy can also achieve this purpose. Immediately after damaging the muscles it is recommended to cool the area to prevent inflammation. Afterwards warming is advantageous to increase blood flow and thereby accelerate healing. It may take a few weeks for the neck muscle to recover. During this time it is better to avoid too intensive activities, which lead to pain."}
