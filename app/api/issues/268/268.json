{"Description":"Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are the two types of malignant diseases of the lymphatic system, collectively called lymphoma. Uncontrolled cell reproduction of the lymphatic system (T- or B-cells) occurs. Both groups are categorised into 4 stages that differentiate in whether they are affecting the lymph node regions (stage I-III) or affecting other tissue but the lymphatic tissue (stage IV). The therapy depends on the current stage.","DescriptionShort":"Lymphoma is a malignant tumor of the lymphatic tissue and its cells (lymph nodes). It is a type of cancer that attacks the immune system. The condition targets particularly immune cells named lymphocytes that are among the white blood cells. There are two types, the Hodgkin’s lymphoma and the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.","MedicalCondition":"The main symptom is the swelling of affected lymph node regions, accompanied by rather unspecific general symptoms, such as fever, loss of weight, a general reduced resilience and tiredness. Liver and spleen can swell. Neurological dysfunctions (changes in consciousness, vertigo, paralysis, lack of sensitivity) may occur, as well as hormonal dysfunctions. Depending on the stage, other, not lymphatic tissues can be affected and cause symptoms (e.g. bone pain, lung infestation).","Name":"Lymph cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Diarrhea,Fever,Weight loss,Skin rash,Swollen glands in the neck,Swollen glands in the armpit,Swollen glands in the groin,Tiredness,Sweating,Night sweats","ProfName":"Lymphoma","Synonyms":"Cancer of lymph nodes,Cancer of the lymph nodes","TreatmentDescription":"In the event of a suspected lymphoma, diagnose will be made with a biopsy and microscopically examination. This is followed by a so-called staging, where the patient will be examined from head to toe to determine the stage of the disease that will be crucial for the course of treatment. A lymphoma is always treated with a combination of chemo- and radio-therapy. Type and duration of chemo- or radio-therapy are decided based on its stage.  While the Hodgkin-lymphoma have a comparably good prognosis, for the non-Hodgkin-lymphoma the prognosis strongly depends on which type of lymphoma, how aggressive it is and how advanced the condition is."}
