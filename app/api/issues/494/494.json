{"Description":"Diverticulitis occurs when small sacs or pouches that form on the inner wall of the intestine, which are called diverticulum, become bacterially infected and inflamed. These sacs and pouches are mostly often found in the large intestine in elderly people due to high pressure test of the intestine.","DescriptionShort":"Diverticulitis describes a bacterial inflammation occurring in a diverticulum, which is an evagination of the wall of the large intestine. A balanced diet with high-fiber can help to prevent the development of a diverticulum. If there are any suspicious symptoms, it is recommended to immediately consult a doctor for a further check.","MedicalCondition":"Diverticulitis is an infectious inflammation in a diverticulum. A diverticulitis develops when a preexisting diverticulum gets obstructed and bacteria, which normally live in high numbers in the large intestine, start to breed uncontrolled in the diverticulum and therefore lead to an inflammation. The diverticulum itself is an asymptomatic evagination of the wall of the large intestine. The formation of diverticulum is associated with a weakened wall of large intestine and high pressure inside the large intestine. The obstruction of the diverticulum with a small amount of stool may lead to inflammation and infection. A diverticulitis can be classified in either closed (uncomplicated), occultly perforated or openly perforated. An openly perforated diverticulitis means that infectious pus is running out of the diverticulum in the peritoneal space. People with diverticulitis may have symptoms such as pain and tenderness in abdomen (typically in the left lower abdomen), bloating, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, and even blood in the stool.","Name":"Inflammation of a diverticulum","PossibleSymptoms":"Rebound tenderness,Abdominal pain,Abdominal guarding,Fever,Lower abdominal pain,Diarrhea,Flatulence,Nausea,Vomiting,Difficult defecation,Blood in stool,Unconsciousness, short,Hard defecation,Painful defecation","ProfName":"Diverticulitis","Synonyms":"Inflammation in diverticulum wall,Inflammation of diverticulum","TreatmentDescription":"Balanced and high-fiber diets can help to decrease the risks of getting diverticulum and therefore diverticulitis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated with antibiotics. Besides, affected people need to fast for several days. If the diverticulitis is openly perforated or becomes a recurring condition, surgery will be necessary. The aim of surgery is to remove the affected parts of the large intestine."}
