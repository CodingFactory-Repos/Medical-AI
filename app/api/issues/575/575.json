Some of these conditions are, for example, severe pain, psychic stress, a sudden change of position, dehydration, loss of blood and heavy coughing. Certain illnesses such as heart disease, neurologic diseases and metabolic diseases can also cause frequent appearance of syncope. Furthermore, syncope can be the side effect of drug and alcohol abuse or allergy. The symptoms of syncope are typically paleness, vertigo and loss of consciousness. Sometimes syncope is announced by nausea, feeling cold, sweating or blurred vision. Low blood sugar and seizure may also cause a loss of consciousness, but this is not classified as syncope since in these cases the underlying mechanism is not an insufficient blood supply.","Name":"Fainting","PossibleSymptoms":"Blackening of vision,Drowsiness,Unconsciousness, short,Feeling faint","ProfName":"Syncope","Synonyms":"Passing out,Swooning","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of syncope depends on its causes.
