{"Description":"Lyme disease is an infection transmitted primarily by a bacteria. This bacteria can be found on ticks with black legs, e.g. named deer tick or ixodes tick. These ticks are found typically in grassy and wooded regions. Lyme disease is found in numerous countries. The diagnosis of the condition can be hard and this leads to wrong diagnostis at the beginning for many people.","DescriptionShort":"Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is an infectious bacterial disease spread by ticks that affects the skin, nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and the heart. It can be treated with antibiotics.","MedicalCondition":"Three stages of the disease are recognized. In the first stage, a couple of days after the bite, a red ring or bullseye on the skin (Erythema migrans) appears, which may be preceded by headaches, lethargy, fever, and joint pain. The redness can last several days to a week and usually heals on its own. In the second stage, after several weeks or months, some patients will experience an attack on the joints, meninges, nerve roots, the skin, and (rarely) the heart. This leads to the third stage, if it is left untreated, which is damage to the organs.","Name":"Lyme disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin redness,Pain in the limbs,Joint pain,Skin rash,Headache,Tiredness,Paralysis,Fever,Neck stiffness,Blue colored skin","ProfName":"Lyme borreliosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"If Lyme disease is identified too late, it can establish itself as chronic symptoms such as lethargy, trouble concentrating, and headaches. Because Lyme’s disease is caused by bacteria, it can be successfully treated in the early stage with antibiotics. Therefore, if bitten by a tick and the above symptoms appear, seek out a doctor immediately.  Tips for dealing with tick bites: 1) You can prevent tick bites by wearing long sleeves and pants, staying out of the under bush and areas with tall grass, and checking yourself for ticks after your excursion. 2) If you were bitten by a tick, remove it from your skin with a pair of tweezers (some tweezers are made especially for this purpose) without crushing the tick and then disinfect the bite area. Do not use oil or other substances to “suffocate” the tick - this will only cause the tick to expel any pathogens it carries."}
