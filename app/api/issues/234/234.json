{"Description":"Medial epicondylitis or Golfer’s elbow, is a condition that triggers pain where the bump of the bone inside the elbow connects with the forearm muscles through their tendons. It is possible for the pain to extent into the forearem and reach the wrist. Golfers are not the only ones to develop the condition and it is related to the medical condition named tennis elbow which occurs on the external side of the elbow. Rest and appropriate treatment can help the patient to recover.","DescriptionShort":"Epicondylitis ulnaris humeri describes a condition caused by overstrain, especially of the forearm’s flexor muscles, that irritates and leads to inflammation in the attachment area of the muscles. This area lies on the inside part of the elbow and the affected patient will recognize the condition because of the strain-related pain in the region. Later, patients experience pain regardless of strain and the movement of hand and fingers can be impaired. It is also commonly known as golf elbow.","MedicalCondition":"The medically named condition epicondylitis ulnaris humeri or better known golfer’s elbow has its source in a damage that has occured to the muscles and tendons which are controlling the fingers and the wrist. It is typically occuring due to repeated or excess stress, especially when the fingers or wrist are moved forcefully. Other factors can contribute to the condition. These factors include poor physical fitness or too little warm-up, and improper hitting, lifting or throwing. Numerous activities can lead to golfer’s elbow including golf since swinging or gripping too forcefully or incorrectly clubs can affect the tendons and muscles. Racket sports can also hurt the elbow with excessive topspin or using a racket which is either too heavy or small. Sports involving throwing such as javelin and archery throwing, softball or baseball may also lead with an improper pitching technique to the condition. Improper technique in lifting weights can overload the muscles and tendons of the elbow. Any other activity that requires bending and straightening repeatedly the elbow can lead to golfer’s elbow.
