{"Description":"Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a slowing down in movement of the affected person. At the beginning of the disease, the face can show no expression or just a little and the arms cannot swing while walking. The speech can become slurred or soft. As the disease progresses gradually, the symptoms can become worse. Even if the tremor is known mostly as the sign of the disease, the condition causes also stiffness of some muscles, and issues with walking and balance. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease but medications may improve significantly the symptoms. In some cases, doctors can suggest surgery in order to alleviate the symptoms by regulating some areas of the brain.","DescriptionShort":"Parkinson’s disease is a condition that causes a slowing down of all movements, hardening of certain muscles, tremors in the hands and feet, and problems with balance and walking. The condition finds its origin in the nervous system and develops gradually. The disease starts sometimes with a tremor in only one hand that is barely noticeable.","MedicalCondition":"Parkinson’s disease mainly affects the elderly and involves a lack of dopamine (a neurotransmitter) in the brain. An inherited variation of the disease can also occur in younger people. Early signs of the disease can include sleep disorders, reduced sense of smell, or a deepening of the voice. Later, symptoms such as the typical slowing of movement and tremors appear, as well as the development of a “mask-like” face and a predisposition towards heavy sweating. Sexual function disorders, stomach and intestinal irregularities may also occur.","Name":"Shaking palsy","PossibleSymptoms":"Physical inactivity,Impaired balance,Muscle stiffness,Tremor at rest,Dry mouth,Dizziness,Morning stiffness,Limited mobility of the leg,Limited mobility of the back,Urge to urinate,Difficulty with gait,Difficult defecation","ProfName":"Parkinson's disease","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Parkinson’s disease still has no cure to this day, but the patient’s symptoms can be relieved. Treatment consists of taking dopamine in the form of Levodopa (L-Dopa) or in the administration of dopamine agonists, which mimic the function of dopamine and balance out the lack of production. These medications allow the patient to move more fluidly and lead an independent life."}
