{"Description":"Testicular torsion occurs when a testicle is twisted in the scrotum, cutting off the flow from the blood vessels that supply the testicle. Causes include powerful twisting movements (for example, in sleep during the dream stage), trauma, or a strong pulling of a muscle that radiates into the testicles (the cremaster muscle).","DescriptionShort":"Torsion of testes happens when the testes rotate. Such rotation curls the spermatic channel that enables blood to reach the scrotum. This causes a reduction in the flow of the blood, triggering often severe and sudden pain as well as swelling.","MedicalCondition":"Testicular torsion mostly occurs during infancy and youth. It is accompanied by a sudden onset of sharp testicular pain that radiates throughout the groin area, as well as reddening of the skin and swelling around the affected testicle. Besides that, pain can cause nausea and vomiting. The affected testicle is extremely sensitive to pressure and is situated higher than a non-affected testicle.","Name":"Torsion of testes","PossibleSymptoms":"Swelling in the genital area,Testicular pain,Swelling of the testicles,Skin redness,Nausea,Vomiting","ProfName":"Testicular torsion","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Testicular torsion is a condition that requires urgent surgery. If blood flow is not reestablished within six hours, the testicular tissue can begin to die off. Itâ€™s possible to manually twist the testicle back into position from outside, but a subsequent operation is required to fix the testicle into place inside the scrotum."}
