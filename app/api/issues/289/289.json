{"Description":"Gastric cancer is a malign stomach tumor. It is most commonly diagnosed after the age of 50. However, about 10% of all cases occur at the age between 30 and 40. Gastric cancer develops more often because of familial predisposition, chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, bacterial colonisation of helicobacter pylori, conditions that cause an excess of gastric acids, or benign gastric tumors. Persons consuming too much salt and cured food are also at a greater risk. Raw fruits and vegetables as well as wholemeal bread may reduce the risk.","DescriptionShort":"Gastric carcinoma, known also as stomach cancer, is a tumor that occurs in the lining of the stomach. It is hard to cure gastric cancer since it is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.","MedicalCondition":"The early stages of gastric cancer cause no symptoms; they are usually detected with a gastroscopy. In very rare cases, early stages located near the cardia may cause difficulty in swallowing. Advanced stages can cause fullness, pressure in the upper abdomen, fatigue, weight loss, performance weakness and anaemia, sudden aversion to certain food (especially meat) and occult stool.","Name":"Stomach cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Pallor,Vomiting,Weight loss,Swollen glands in the neck,Black stools,Heartburn,Nausea,Vomiting blood,Reduced appetite,Cough,Tiredness,Abdominal pain,Sore throat,Bloated feeling in the stomach,Sweating,Stomach burning,Burning in the throat,Early satiety","ProfName":"Gastric carcinoma","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Patients who are complaining about discomfort of the upper abdomen for a prolonged period of time should get a gastroscopy, especially if they are older than 50, to rule out gastric cancer. If the tissue sample taken during the gastroscopy confirms gastric cancer, treatment will usually be partial or complete removal of the stomach. In advanced stages, chemotherapy might be indicated prior to the surgery, to reduce the tumor. Structures often affected by metastases (lymph nodes, fat layers of large and small intestines) will be removed as well. Survival time depends on the tumor stage and operability. In early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 95%, in advanced stages and metastases only 10%."}
