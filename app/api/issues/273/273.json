{"Description":"Various factors can cause an intestinal obstruction. Adhesions in the abdominal region (e.g. following abdominal surgery in the past) or parts of the intestines rotating against each other can cause intestinal constrictions. This is called obstructive ileus. Various medications, operations or accidents can cause the digestive tract muscles to cramp or to be paralysed, stopping transport to the lumen. This is called functional ileus. An obstructive ileus can disrupt the blood supply or cause parts of the intestine to die. The blockage of intestinal contents may also cause bacteria entering the systemic circulation (blood poisoning) and damages due to a higher level of bacteriologically produced poisons.","DescriptionShort":"An intestinal obstruction is an bowel obstruction. It can be caused by various mechanisms and often occurs as an emergency that requires immediate treatment in a hospital, due to the risk of life-threatening complications.","MedicalCondition":"Depending on the intestinal obstructionsâ€˜ location, different symptoms may occur, such as colic pain, flatulence, nausea and vomiting or a bloated and stretched abdomen.
