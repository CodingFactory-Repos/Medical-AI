{"Description":"Vocal cord paralysis is the paralysis of muscles of the vocal cords in the larynx. The paralysis results mainly from an interruption of nerve impulses to the larynx. It affects primarily the normal ability of speaking. In severe cases with bilateral paralysis of both vocal cords, patients may also suffer from breathing problems.","DescriptionShort":"Vocal cord paralysis describes the paralysis of the muscles of the vocal cords. The treatment of vocal cord paralysis is mainly voice therapy. In severe cases, surgery is able to improve vocal functions.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of a vocal cord paralysis is either due to a direct injury of the vocal cord, for example caused by surgery or overuse, or, which is much more common, due to the interruption of nerve impulses between brain and larynx. The underlying cause for such nerve damage can be: 1) Damage on the laryngeal nerve (nervus reccurens) in the neck area, mostly caused by surgery of the thyroid gland, 2) Laryngeal nerve damage in the chest area as seen in cases with apical lung cancer or aortic dissection, 3) tumors of the thyroid gland, 4) infections or inflammation in a related area, 5) stroke, and 6) other neurological problems. People with vocal cord paralysis can have symptoms such as a husky voice, hoarseness, noisy breathing, and loss of voice or vocal pitch. Furthermore, people may have swallowing difficulties in terms of chocking and coughing. If both vocal cords are paralyzed, it may lead to an obstruction of the larynx and therefore to respiratory problems.","Name":"Vocal cord paralysis","PossibleSymptoms":"Hoarseness","ProfName":"Vocal cord paresis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a vocal cord paralysis will depend on the severity. Usually, the treatment includes voice therapy. Voice therapy can help to strengthen the vocal cords and accelerate the regain of vocal functions. In severe cases, surgery will be necessary to fixate one vocal cord and thereby enable a better voice generation."}
