{"Description":"Dyslipidemia is an imbalance of lipids (cholesterol and fat) in the blood. There are different fats present in the blood, including cholesterols, triglycerides, as well as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). An imbalance of blood lipids (for example, an increase in VLDL, LDL, and IDL as well as a decrease in HDL) can lead to calcification of the blood vessels as well as a heart attack or stroke. Dyslipidemia is often associated with other diseases such as abdominal obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Types of dyslipidemia are organized according to their causes. Causes may be bad eating habits as well as other diseases such as diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, kidney disease, genetic diseases, or medications (cortisone, diuretics, birth control) or pregnancy.","DescriptionShort":"Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism (handling of lipoproteins in the body), which is either resulting into lipoprotein deficiency or overproduction. The condition can encompass an elevation of the total cholesterol considered as the bad lipoprotein of low density and a decrease in the concentration of good cholesterol or lipoprotein of high density in the blood.","MedicalCondition":"About 50% of the population above the age of 40 in developed countries suffers from some sort of dyslipidemia (especially high cholesterol levels). The blood vessels of patients with increase blood lipids are prone to hardening of the vessel walls (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to heart attacks, stroke, and circulation disorders in the limbs (peripheral artery disease). Besides that, patients with high blood lipid levels may also suffer from pancreatitis. Storage of blood lipids in the liver may also occur, which can lead to fatty liver disease (steatosis of the liver) or hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). Furthermore, it can lead to fat depositions in the skin known as xanthomas.","Name":"Disorders of lipid metabolism","PossibleSymptoms":"Overweight,Skin nodules,Leg swelling","ProfName":"Dyslipidemia","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"If blood lipid levels can be lowered, then the risk of a heart attack and overall mortality will also be significantly reduced. Healthier levels can be achieved through medication, an improvement in dietary habit, weight loss, and regular physical exercise. Besides that, other illnesses that cause increased blood lipids should be treated properly and alcohol should be avoided."}
