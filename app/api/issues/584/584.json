{"Description":"A trauma in general refers to any injury or damage caused by violence force. There are physical traumas, e.g. wounds, burns or fractures, or mental traumas after surviving a psychologically difficult situation, e.g. rape or abduction. Physical traumas are additionally differentiated based on their severeness. If it is a single, minor injury it is called lesion or simple trauma, if it is a life-threatening single injury (e.g. after use of force on the abdomen) it is called barytrauma. A traffic accident or a fall usually causes multiple injuries out of which at least one, sometimes more of them are life-threatening. This is then called polytrauma (major trauma).","DescriptionShort":"A trauma is an injury. It can be a physical injury (fracture, wound) or a mental injury (e.g. after rape).

Talk therapy or short- or long-term medication help in the event of mental traumas. Sometimes an in-patient therapy in a specialized clinic might be necessary. A complication of a mental trauma is the post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for physical traumas also depends on the injury. Simple fractures or wounds can be stitched or rested in a plaster cast, while complicated or shifted fractures as well as contaminated, large wounds may require surgery. The more severe the injury or the more injuries a patient has, the more comprehensive is the treatment. Polytraumatized patients often need intensive care with ventilation or multiple surgeries."}
