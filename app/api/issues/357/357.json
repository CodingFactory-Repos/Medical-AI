{"Description":"Prostate cancer occurs in the male prostate. It is the most common form of malignant tumor in men. It grows on the dorsal region of the prostate and can be partly felt with the finger (digital-rectal examination) from the rectum. The risk of prostate cancer increases with age. To detect it early on and thus have a better chance of treating the tumor, itâ€™s recommended for men over 50 to get screened for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Risk factors are obesity, Afro-American heritage and consuming high dosages of multivitamin products.","DescriptionShort":"Prostate cancer is the most common form of malignant cancer in men. It grows on the dorsal region of the prostate and can be detected early in most case, when going for a regular check-up. Despite the growth, many patients experience no symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"Patients do not have any typical symptoms during the early stage of prostate cancer. At a later stage, they are mainly problems when passing water, such as urine drippling, frequent urination or blood in urine. Many patients also suffer from back pain or pelvic pain.
