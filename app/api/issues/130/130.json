{"Description":"There are different causes and localisations for abdominal wall hernias. The weakness in the abdomen can be congenital or acquired, and depending on their location, can be seen or felt when the intestinal loops emerge. The intestinal loops may emerge permanently or slide back.","DescriptionShort":"A hernia (fracture) is a weakness in the muscles of the abdomen or its aponeurosis, through which the intestinal loops and peritoneum can repeatedly or permanently emerge, and become visible or feelable as a protrusion.","MedicalCondition":"Persons suffering from abdominal wall hernia usually experience a pulling pain around the hernia, especially under strain, but also when standing or coughing. The protrusion caused by the emerging intestinal loops can be visually disturbing or can have the effect that for example pants wonâ€™t fit anymore. Additionally, patients often experience indigestion or pain while passing stool.","Name":"Abdominal hernia","PossibleSymptoms":"Bulging abdominal wall,Nausea,Abdominal pain,Swelling in the genital area,Swelling of the testicles,Testicular pain,Distended abdomen","ProfName":"Abdominal wall hernia","Synonyms":"Hernia","TreatmentDescription":"Typical symptoms and palpatory findings lead the doctor to the correct diagnosis.
