{"Description":"Pelvic bones include the bones of hip, coccyx and sacrum. And a pelvic fracture is a disruption happening to any of these pelvic bones. The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.","DescriptionShort":"A pelvic fracture is a disruption of the bony structures, which happens in the pelvis. However, pelvic fractures can be caused by many reasons, but most pelvic fractures result from high-energy forces such as a motorbike accident or fall from a height. An immediate medical treatment is necessary when pelvic fractures happen.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of pelvic fractures include: 1) Avulsion fracture: these fractures usually occur when there is a sudden muscle contraction happening. Some pieces of pelvic bones will be torn away by the contractions of muscles. 2) Osteoporosis: elder people with osteoporosis have higher risks of getting pelvic fractures. Osteoporosis can result in the fractures because of the weakened bony structure. However, it will not damage the whole structure of the pelvic ring, but certain weak parts of the pelvic bones. 3) High-energy forces: this is the most common reason of getting pelvic fractures. For example, car accidents, a sudden high-energy force or fall from a height. The type of pelvic fracture can be very dangerous. It is very important to seek a medical treatment immediately. The common symptoms include pain, swelling and bruise of the pelvis.","Name":"Pelvic fracture","PossibleSymptoms":"Limited mobility of the leg,Hip pain,Unconsciousness, short,Bone fracture,Feeling of residual urine,Blood in stool,Blackening of vision,Lower abdominal pain,Hip deformity,Limited mobility of the hip","ProfName":"Fracture of the pelvic ring","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of pelvic fractures depend on the causes and the severity of the damage determines the care for a pelvic fracture. Fractures from low energy can be handled often with conservative treatment. The avulsion fracture may heal spontaneously, but the patient will need to use a walker to avoid too much stress on the pelvis. For some severe pelvic fractures caused by high energy  impact, such as fractures caused by accidents, a surgery is usually necessary because this kind of fracture often is accompanied by extensive bleeding and surgery will also be needed in order to rebuild the pelvis with the objective to restore stability that will enable the patients to restart their regular activities. Besides, medication such as pain reliever can help to relieve the discomforts."}
