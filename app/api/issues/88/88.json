{"Description":"A stroke occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is severely reduced or interrupted, depriving a person's brain tissue of nutrients and oxygen. The cells of the brain start to die within minutes. Quick treatment is vital since it can minimize potential complications and brain damage.","DescriptionShort":"A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function due to lack of blood flow to or hemorrhage in the brain. A stroke constitutes an emergency situation. It is a life-threatening, serious medical condition.","MedicalCondition":"Lack of blood flow to an area of the brain is caused by arteriosclerotic plaque that has built up in the brainâ€™s vessels, detach and  forming blood clots.  Another cause is a clot that originates in the heart (thrombus) due to a heart disorder, usually in the context of atrial fibrillation (see article on atrial fibrillation).  Hemorrhages occur predominantly in patients with high blood pressure or hemodilution. Depending on the area the stroke occurs in, patients may have different symptoms that sudden occur, such as paralysis, speech disorders, impaired sense of feeling, impaired awareness, or impaired sight.","Name":"Stroke","PossibleSymptoms":"Difficulty in speaking,Difficulty in swallowing,Double vision, acute-onset,Disorientation regarding time or place,Dizziness,Double vision,Facial paralysis,Headache,Immobilization,Impaired balance,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Paralysis,Problems with the sense of touch in the face,Drowsiness,Tiredness,Visual field loss,Vomiting,Weakness or numbness on right or left side of body,Trouble understanding speech,Physical inactivity,Limited mobility of the leg,Night sweats,Difficulty with gait,Difficulty in finding words,Difficulty to concentrate,Unconsciousness, short,Blackening of vision","ProfName":"Cerebrovascular accident","Synonyms":"Brain attack","TreatmentDescription":"Strokes require immediate medical attention, or permanent damage to the brain may increase and as well result in paralysis. The quicker the treatment begins after a stroke, the higher are the chances of recovery. Treatment involves dissolving clots with strong blood thinners and reestablishing blood flow to the affected area of the brain. The cause for the stroke needs to be discovered and treated accordingly."}
