{"Description":"A melanoma is a so-called black cancer of the skin. It forms from the abnormal changes of melanocytes (pigment-producing skin cells). It is one of the most dangerous skin cancers and can be life-threatening.","DescriptionShort":"Melanoma is a malignant cancer occurring on the skin. It is caused by abnormal melanocytes (pigment containing cells). It can be dangerous if itâ€™s not found in the early stages. Surgery to remove the affected area is usually necessary. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy are also used in some cases.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of melanoma is the abnormal changes in melanocytes (pigment containing cells). Risk factors are: Sunburns in the childhood and youth, immunosuppression, genetic factors (white race, albinism, xeroderma pigmentosum and affected family member) and dysplastic nevi (=abnormal dark birthmarks). There are several types of melanoma: 1) Superficial spreading melanoma: the melanoma has flat but irregular shapes and different colors. 2) Nodular melanoma: the melanoma is not flat but raised. The raised areas are normally black and dark blue or red. This form is especially malignant because it tends to spread into the depth of the skin, which makes metastases more likely. 3) Lentigo maligna melanoma: the melanoma rises on base of a lentigo maligna. This skin alteration often appears due to over-exposure to sunlight, especially on the face, neck and arms. 4) Acral lentiginous melanoma: the melanoma often appears on nails, palms, soles and mucosa. 5.) Amelanotic melanoma: a nodular melanoma without dark pigmentation. Possible indications of melanoma based on the acronym ABCDE include 1) Asymmetry: it often is unevenly shaped, 2) Borders: the edges are irregular, 3) Color: the melanoma has different colors (very dark and brighter areas in the same lesion), 4) Diameter: the melanoma is usually larger than 5mm in diameter, 5) Evolution: it may change in appearance, either in size or color.","Name":"Black skin cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Irregular mole","ProfName":"Melanoma","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of melanoma is to surgically remove the affected areas including a safety distance. Additional chemotherapy can kill the cancer cells to prevent the cancer from returning. Immunotherapy with medications like interleukin or interferon can be used to strengthen the immune system to fight against the cancer. Radiation therapy can be used if a patient cannot get surgery for reasons like bad general condition or a concomitant disease. If there is any suspicious symptom of melanoma, it is recommended that you consult a dermatologist for early intervention because the risk for metastases is directly depending on the depth of the melanoma."}
