{"Description":"Measles is caused by a virus and is very contagious. Measles can be very unpleasant and can lead sometimes to serious complications. Anyone can get measles if he has not been vaccinated. People who did not have measles before can also get it if they come in contact with an infected person. However, the condition is most common in young children. The infection disappears usually in around 7 to 10 days.","DescriptionShort":"Measles, also known as morbilli, is a viral infection that commonly affects children and causes a skin rash, fever, and swelling of the lymph nodes. It is very contagious and there is a vaccine for it.","MedicalCondition":"The infection begins with flu-like symptoms (runny nose, fever, cough) and subsequently develops into a fever and a rash with large spots that spread from the head downward. The lymph nodes are also swollen enough to be felt. Because the measles weakens the immune system, other dangerous secondary infections of the lung or brain can develop. The measles can remain undetected for several years after the initial attack and attack the brain, which can lead to death.","Name":"Measles","PossibleSymptoms":"Burning eyes,Burning in the throat,Cough,Eye redness,Fever,Itching eyes,Pain in the limbs,Runny nose,Skin rash,Sore throat,Swollen glands in the armpit,Swollen glands in the groin,Swollen glands in the neck,Tiredness,Oversensitivity to light,Facial swelling,Flaking skin","ProfName":"Morbilli","Synonyms":"Red measles","TreatmentDescription":"To prevent measles, an effort to vaccinate the entire population is being undertaken to protect from the consequences of the infection. Two shots are required, the first one at 12 months of age and the second at 15-24 months. The shot is combined with other vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). If an infection with measles occurs, the infected child should not be allowed contact with other children for 5 days after the outbreak of the rash to prevent the infection from spreading.  People who have come in contact with the infected child (classmates, for example) and who have not had measles or been vaccinated against them should stay at home for 14 days for the same reason. There is no treatment for measles. The only protection against measles is the vaccination or a previous measles infection."}
