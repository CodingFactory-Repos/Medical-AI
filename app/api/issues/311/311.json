{"Description":"Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease. An autoimmune cause is suspected, in which the body's defense system (immune system) attacks its own healthy cells. Crohn's disease can affect every segment of the intestinal tract, from the mouth till the anus. Most frequently the lower portion of the small intestine and the colon are affected. It is typical for this disease, that several intestine sections are affected at the same time, interrupted by sections that are perfectly healthy. In addition to the intestine, other organs such as eyes, joints or skin may be affected as well.","DescriptionShort":"Crohn's disease is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease can affect every segment of the intestinal tract, from the mouth till the anus. In addition to the intestine, other organs such as eyes, joints or skin may be affected as well. Although the disease can not be cured, it can be controlled by medication.","MedicalCondition":"Crohn's disease usually occurs between the age of 15 and 35, or after the age of 60. The condition runs in families and affects tobacco smokers twice as often as non-smokers. Typical symptoms are abdominal pain and prolonged, sometimes bloody diarrhoea. Depending on the location of the affected intestinal segments, wounds inside the mouth (vesicles) or pain, especially in the right lower abdomen may occur as well. Further, joints can be swollen and painful, most commonly affecting the knees, or in rare cases the spine and pelvic joints. Eyes and skin may also be affected, which is very painful.","Name":"Crohn's disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Eye redness,Eye pain,Abdominal pain,Flatulence,Blood in stool,Diarrhea,Fever,Joint pain,Weight loss,Pain in the limbs,Skin rash,Tiredness,Black stools,Underweight,Bloated feeling in the stomach,Lower abdominal pain,Vomiting,Nausea,Reduced appetite,Distended abdomen,Pain of the anus,Itching of the anus","ProfName":"Regional enteritis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The prolonged disease duration and permanent minor blood-loss can lead to fatigue and exhaustion as a result of anaemia. During the course of the illness, the intestinal walls will be damaged more and more. It can happen that an intestinal loop “breaks” into another one, which is called fistula. In rare cases, the intestinal cavity can be blocked (ileus) and needs to be treated surgically. Crohn’s disease is usually diagnosed with a colonoscopy or gastroscopy, where mucous membrane samples are collected and examined. Crohn’s disease is a lengthy, incurable disease. Treatment aims at suppressing the body’s defence system to alleviate the enteritis and with it the symptoms. Surgeries are often necessary to remove strongly damaged intestinal sections."}
