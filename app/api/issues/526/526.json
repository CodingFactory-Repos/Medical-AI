{"Description":"Tendons are the cords that connect bones to muscles in the body and are sometimes covered by a sleeve-like tissue, the tendon sheath. Tenosynovitis is an inflammation of this tendon sheath. It occurs most often in the hand, wrist, or foot.","DescriptionShort":"Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the lining of the sheath that surrounds a tendon. Tenosynovitis caused by bacterial infection leads to intense pain and normally requires an immediate treatment.","MedicalCondition":"Causes of tenosynovitis include bacterial infection, mostly due to an injury, and repetitive motions such as those used for computer operation, assembly line work, sports that involve repetitive actions or playing musical instruments. The most common symptoms are joint pain, joint stiffness, joint swelling, severe pain when moving a joint, redness and swelling along the length of the tendons.","Name":"Tendon sheath inflammation","PossibleSymptoms":"Stress-related leg pain,Limited mobility of the ankle","ProfName":"Tenosynovitis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment depends on the cause of the tenosynovitis. The goal of a treatment of non-infectious tenosynovitis is to reduce swelling and pain and to allow the tendon to move freely. Treatment options include the following: 1) rest, 2) physical therapy, 3) ice or heat packing, 4) medication as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, topical pain medicines and corticosteroids. In case of bacterial infection antibiotics were needed and ultimately if necessary, one has to undergo an operation to save the tendon from permanent damage."}
