{"Description":"The nociceptor is a nerve ending, which will send a signal to the brain when faced with certain stimuli. This may result in a physical feeling of pain, which is also known as nociception. Pain is a perception that signals to people that a physical damage or mental trauma has occurred or may be occurring. However, pain is subjective and very complex. Even though nociceptors all over the body are signalizing pain, the actual sensation of pain is solely located in the brain.","DescriptionShort":"Pain is an unpleasant feeling that can be triggered by physical damage or mental traumas. It can be classified as either acute or chronic pain. A doctor will help to determine the cause and then prescribe a proper treatment after diagnosis.","MedicalCondition":"Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain lasts a short period of time and is expected to be over soon. Chronic pain lasts much longer. It may last even after recovery of an injury or damage, and continue for several months or longer. However, pain can be categorized into three different types: 1) nociceptive pain, 2) neurogenic pain, and 3) psychogenic pain. Nociceptive pain occurs when there is damage to tissue in the body registered by nociceptors, and neurogenic pain occurs when there is damage to the nervous system. Neurogenic pain is usually not felt at the location of damage but instead in the area of innervations of the damaged nerves. In addition, not only can physical damage cause pain, but mental traumas are also implicated in certain instances of pain. Psychogenic pain is the pain caused by mental and emotional problems. Pain may have characteristics such as being sharp, burning or dull. It may come and go, or it may be on a constant level. Pain can be present in any area of the human body. Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. Without pain, people might get hurt without knowing, or might not realize some medical issues.","Name":"Pain","PossibleSymptoms":"Fast, deepened breathing","ProfName":"Pain-related issues","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of pain will mainly depend on the cause, and may include: 1) several oral or intravenous medications, 2) local injection treatments, 3) physical and occupational therapy, 4) Electrical stimulation, 5) alternative medicine, 6) psychological support and 7) surgery. Once the underlying problems are found and treated, the related pain usually quickly diminishes or becomes treatable. More problematic is the therapy of chronic pain with no detectable morphological substrate."}
