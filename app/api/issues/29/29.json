{"Description":"Suspicious skin lesions are most commonly mentioned in relation to a suspected skin cancer. Especially the A-B-C-D-E rule for the screening of moles and birthmarks helps to separate harmless birthmarks from suspicious ones. A stands for Asymmetry, lesions that are asymmetric are suspicious. B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm. E stands for Evolving, suspicious are moles that are evolving above the skin level. Repeatedly bleeding or not healing wounds, even without a birthmark may be the so-called white skin cancer, especially if it occurs in typical regions. Typical regions are parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, face, hands, forearms, for women also the décolleté, for men also the scalp.","DescriptionShort":"A suspicious skin lesion is most commonly mentioned if it shows one or more of the symptoms below: Noticeable moles (that are asymmetric or have uneven borders, a variety of colors, changing rapidly, itching or bleeding), not healing wounds, especially in typical regions (parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as face, scalp, neck, décolleté, forearms and hands), noticeable scales, itching. Changes to the skin, especially suspicious ones should be examined by a doctor – ideally by a dermatologist.","MedicalCondition":"A suspicious change of the skin might be caused by an infection in or on the skin such as a wart. The virus of a wart is transmitted through skin contact. Shingles or chickenpox that happens throughout the body can also trigger suspicious changes of skin. Birthmarks are changes of skin that are usually present since birth. Some suspicious changes can follow a sensitivity or an allergic response triggered by conditions such as diabetes or poor circulation. Autoimmune illnesses like psoriasis can also trigger changes on the skin. Most cancers are detected through obvious signs such as sickness, pain, tenderness, bumps or lumps. However, it is difficult to identify a change of skin since the change is not often obvious. The detection of a suspicious change of skin is tricky because usually this change happens gradually and without clear signs. However, it is recommended to use always a thumb to feel for any change while making the difference between normal and unusual detail. A person should pay attention to lesions, moles, and spots present on the body in order to compare it with details that seem different. Other suspicious signs include changes happening on a mole such as bleeding, oozing or the presence of a nodule or bump, pain, tenderness or itchiness. Further signs that should be considered as a warning are a new engorgement beyond the limit, redness or a tenderness that is hard to heal. A pigment that spreads from its boundary into the skin all around should be taken as a warning sign as well.","Name":"Suspicious change of skin","PossibleSymptoms":"Non-healing skin wound,Irregular mole,Scar,Blue spot on skin","ProfName":"Suspicious lesion of skin","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Suspicious skin lesions can occur at any age. If an affected person observes a lesion that matches the criteria mentioned above, or worries for other reasons, he should consult a doctor, ideally a dermatologist. If the doctor finds the skin lesion suspicious as well, it will usually be removed surgically. A pathologist will evaluate the removed tissue under a microscope. If the suspicion is confirmed, the doctor will discuss the next steps with the affected person. Depending on the pathologist’s findings, the previous surgery may have been sufficient, but sometimes a larger area around the lesion might be needed to be removed, or further therapy (chemo-, radiotherapy) may be necessary."}
