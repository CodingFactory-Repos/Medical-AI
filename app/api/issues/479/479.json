{"Description":"A jaw fracture is usually the condition of broken bones in the lower jaw (mandible, mandibular bones) or sometimes in the upper jaw (maxilla, facial bones). The fracture of the mandible is among the most common fractures because the anatomic location of the mandible is prominent and for this reason can be hit first. Various blunt shocks to the jaw such as direct assault used to be frequent causes of a mandibular fracture before common usage of automobiles. Nowadays, automobile accidents are often the cause of a mandibular fracture. Most of the time, just the nose is damaged. A mandibular fracture is a frequent facial injury resulting from a direct blow to the jaw. This fracture means that the joint that connects the jaw to the skull is dislocated. Sometimes, the jawbone is not fractured but symptoms may appear similar to the fracture of the jawbone.","DescriptionShort":"A jaw fracture is the condition of broken bones in mandibular bones or facial bones (maxilla).
