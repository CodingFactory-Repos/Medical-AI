{"Description":"Hirsuties papillaris penis is a common skin disorder for males that looks like a protrusion arranged neatly at the base of the coronae or in the glans of the penis. It disappears after quite some time. This condition is not a dangerous disease. It is just a common occurrence for men during their period of adolescence. The condition is also called hirsuties coronae glandis or pearly penile papules.","DescriptionShort":"Hirsuties papillaris penis, which is also called hirsuties coronae or pearly penile papules, is the condition when there are small white- or flesh-colored verruciform domes forming around the penis. It is harmless to the human body. It neither is a sexually transmitted disease or a sort of warts, nor is it contagious.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of hirsuties papillaris penis is unknown. Some researchers think it is an atavism, which means it is an occurrence of a body feature from evolutionary ancestors. It is also known that the percentage of circumcised men who have hirsuties papillaris penis is lower than those among uncircumcised men and that it occurs with increased frequency in certain families. However, the most important thing is that hirsuties papillaris penis is not caused by a sexually transmitted disease, or by bad hygiene, nor is it contagious. It is a totally harmless skin alteration. Usually it appears during the teenage years or between the ages of 20 to 40 years.","Name":"Hirsuties coronae glandis","PossibleSymptoms":"Genital warts","ProfName":"Hirsuties papillaris genitalis","Synonyms":"Pearly penile papules","TreatmentDescription":"Since hirsuties papillaris penis is harmless and not contagious, it requires no treatment.
