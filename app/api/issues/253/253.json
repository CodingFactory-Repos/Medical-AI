{"Description":"Hallux Valgus, often referred to as ‘a bunion’, is the most common deformity of the forefoot. It is estimated that 23% to 35% of people have the condition. Symptoms appear on the sole of the foot, its medial edge and the small toes. It can be possible to alleviate symptoms with non-operative treatment but the treatment doesn't fix the malformation of the big toe.","DescriptionShort":"Hallux valgus describes the most common malposition of the big toe, caused by the foot’s flattening and splaying, and resulting in a malfunction of the foot muscles. The metatarsophalangeal joint can be damaged to a different degree.","MedicalCondition":"Hallux valgus tends to run in families and women are more affected than men. Other causes may comprise arthritis, other syndromes or illnesses such as Marfan syndrome and cerebral palsy. Inappropriate shoes that do not fit correctly can contribute to the occurrence of the condition since tight shoes may rub against the big toe joint and high-heeled shoes may squeeze the feet, causing the big toe to be stuck in a leaned position. Such position keeps the big toe stretched. The nerve around the big toe will be pressured, triggering pain. In addition, high heels push most of the body weight forward onto the front part of the foot, which puts significant strain on the joints of the toe. The main symptom of the condition is the big toe directing in the way of the other toes present on the same foot. This may lead to the foot bone linked to the big toe to point outwards. Secondary symptoms may comprise sore skin above the upper part of the hallux valgus, red, callused and hard skin generated by the overlapping of the great toe and the following toe, swelling and pain on the joint of the great toe. Changes to the form of the foot may make it hard to find appropriate shoes and wearing shoes may then trigger a pressure that makes the pain worse. In addition the affected person may also experience a bony, swollen lump on the external brink of the foot. Many sufferers complain in particular about pressure discomfort on the big toe at the bottom and on the side and in the big toe itself as well as about pain, which can also extend to the bottom of the second and third toe.","Name":"Bunion","PossibleSymptoms":"Foot pain,Skin redness,Toe deformity,Toe swelling","ProfName":"Hallux valgus","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment depends on the patient’s age, medical history and activity, as well as the damage to the metatarsophalangeal joint.
