{"Description":"Mitral valve insufficiency is also called mitral regurgitation is  a common valvular defect that affects the valve between the left atrium and the left chamber.  Blood flows back into the left atrium from the left chamber as the left chamber contracts and ejects blood into the aorta.","DescriptionShort":"Mitral valve insufficiency is a common valvular defect. It occurs when the mitral valve of the heart is unable to close tightly. This condition enables blood to move back into the heart. This makes the blood unable to flow efficiently through the heart or to other parts of the body, making the breath short or the body tired.","MedicalCondition":"Mitral valve insufficiency often affects older patients, but it can also occur in young people during a bacterial or rheumatic infection of the valve. Patients often do not notice any symptoms for a long time. Symptoms can be shortness of breath, palpitations, and night coughing attacks. If valve damage suddenly arises, water can quickly accumulate in the lungs (edema of the lungs).","Name":"Mitral regurgitation","PossibleSymptoms":"Shortness of breath,Chest pain,Chest tightness,Cough,Night cough,Feeling faint,Heart murmur,Palpitations,Blue colored skin","ProfName":"Mitral valve insufficiency","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Slight forms of mitral valve insufficiency are relatively common and harmless and usually require no treatment. Only serious forms that cause complaints require treatment by a specialist, as it will develop into arrhythmia and result in overstress of the heart. If medication fails to aid the situation, restorative surgery or (rarely) replacement of the mitral valve is suggested."}
