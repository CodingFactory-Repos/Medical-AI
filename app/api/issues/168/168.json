{"Description":"The word dementia describes a set of symptoms that can encompass difficulties with language, with problem-solving, with thinking and last but not least with memory loss. Dementia is often referred imprecisely to as “senile dementia” or “senility”, which reflects the not precise but widespread belief that severe mental failure is a normal part of aging.","DescriptionShort":"Dementia is not a specific disease. It is an overall term that describes a large range of symptoms connected with a decline of thinking skills such as memory. This decline is enough severe to reduce the ability of the patient to perform everyday activities.","MedicalCondition":"Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells and this damage makes the communication between brain cells less effective. This can affect feelings, thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. Symptoms of dementia can vary largely. The disease affects visual perception, judgment and reasoning, ability to pay attention and focus, language and communication, and memory. People with the condition may have issues with short-term memory, planning and cooking meals, paying bills, keeping track of a wallet or purse, remembering neighbors or the neighborhood or remembering appointments. Many dementias are progressive. This means that symptoms begin slowly and get worse gradually.","Name":"Senility","PossibleSymptoms":"Forgetfulness,Disorientation regarding time or place,Immobilization,Difficulty in speaking,Aggressiveness,Anxiety,Agitation,Memory gap,Difficulty in finding words,Sleeplessness","ProfName":"Dementia","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of dementia depends on its cause. For progressive dementias, there is no treatment and no cure that stops or slows its progression. However, there is medication that may improve symptoms temporarily. If a loved one is experiencing some memory troubles or issues in thinking skills, it should be taken seriously. The affected person should visit immediately a doctor to investigate these. A professional assessment can detect a condition that can be treatable. An early diagnosis of dementia can allow the patient to benefit greatly from available treatments and it offers time to plan for the future."}
