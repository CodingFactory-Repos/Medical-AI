{"Description":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or benign enlargement of the prostate is common in advanced age. Starting at the age of 40, most men experience significant enlargement of the prostate. This growth is a benign volume increase of the prostate in the area surrounding the urethra.","DescriptionShort":"Benign enlargement of the prostate (or benign prostatic hyperplasia) is the most common benign tumor in men.  Enlargement of the prostate makes urination difficult, causes the urine to flow back along the urinary tract, and may also cause bladder or kidney infections.","MedicalCondition":"BPH causes the urinary tract to become narrowed and this can cause urine to flow backwards. People with BPH notice that it takes longer to urinate, the stream of urine is weaker, and when urination has finished, they still feel that the bladder has not been completely emptied and drops of urine continue to drip. Additionally, an urge to urinate frequently develops and intensifies during the night. Depending on the growth of BPH, the sex life of the person with it may be negatively affected and have an influence in the patient’s quality of life. Retention of urine often causes infections of the bladder and the kidneys. If you notice these symptoms, consult a specialist (urologist) immediately.","Name":"Benign prostate enlargement","PossibleSymptoms":"Decreased urine stream,Delayed start to urination,Dribbling after urination,Feeling of residual urine,Frequent urination,Painful urination,Urge to urinate,Urination during the night,Impairment of male potency","ProfName":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia needs to be differentiated from malignant prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common form of malignant cancer in men. It affects preferencially the dorsal prostate region and can be partly felt with the finger (digital-rectal examination) from the rectum. Despite the tumor growth, many patients experience no symptoms. To detect it early on and thus have a better chance of treating the tumor, it’s recommended for men over 50 to get screened for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)."}
