{"Description":"The pituitary is a small gland shaped like a bean. It is situated at the base of the brain, behind the nose and between the ears. The pituitary gland is the control center for several hormones. Hypopituitarism is a disorder in which the pituitary gland either fails to produce one or more of its hormones or does not produce enough of them.","DescriptionShort":"Hypofunction of the pituitary gland, also known as hypopituitarism, describes a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its associated hormones. It can affect the body's functions such as growth, blood pressure and reproduction. Hormonal supplementation is a common treatment.","MedicalCondition":"Causes of hypopituitarism include brain surgery, brain tumor, head trauma, infection or inflammation of the brain or the meninges, radiation therapy, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, thrombosis of the pituitary veins and tumor of the pituitary gland. Sometimes it may also be as a result of a complication during pregnancy, which is known as Sheehanâ€™s syndrome. The symptoms may vary and can include sexual disorders (loss in sexual interest, cycle disorder and puberty disorders), gain of weight, excessive urination or thirst, fatigue, headaches, hair and weight loss, weakness and short stature.","Name":"Hypofunction of pituitary gland","PossibleSymptoms":"Sensitivity to cold,Weight gain,Mood swings,Tiredness,Vision impairment,Headache,Menstruation disorder,Pallor","ProfName":"Hypopituitarism","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Therapy includes hormonal supplementation and evaluation of the cause. If the hypopituitarism is caused by a tumor, then surgery will be needed to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy may also be indicated. Generally speaking, patients with hypopituitarism need long-term hormone medications to replace hormones that are no longer produced by the organs due to failure of the pituitary gland. The medications may include corticosteroid, growth hormones, sex hormones and thyroid hormones."}
