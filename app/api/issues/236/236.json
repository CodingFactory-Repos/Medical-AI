{"Description":"Epilepsy can develop due to several causes ranging from an abnormal brain structure (presence of scars from infection, tumors, trauma or malformation) to metabolic disorders, excessive consumption of alcohol, or genetic predispositions. A seizure happens when the brain’s nerve cells fail to function correctly. Symptoms are stereotypic for each patient, depending on the area of the brain that the electrical discharge takes place. Generalized seizures (Grand Mal seizure, absence seizure) affect both hemispheres of the brain and are distinguished from focal seizures that only affect specific regions of the brain without the patient experiencing loss of consciousness.","DescriptionShort":"Epilepsy is a chronic disorder and its characteristic is unprovoked, recurrent seizures. Many people with epilepsy have over one type of seizure and can have also other symptoms of neurological issues. The epileptic attacks are accompanied by a loss in consciousness, muscular convulsions, a change in muscle tone, and changes in perception.","MedicalCondition":"Epilepsy occurs in 0.5% of the population. Seizures occur in different frequencies and at different intervals. Patients usually experience warning signs before a seizure such as nausea, feeling hot, or unusual and indescribable feelings. Sleep deprivation and alcohol withdrawal as well as hard breathing can trigger a seizure. A Grand Mal seizure is the most common form of epilepsy and presents as loss of consciousness, falling, muscle cramps, and muscle convulsions. After several minutes, a period of confusion and drowsiness follows until the patient regains normal awareness. The patient cannot remember the event. During the seizure the patient may bite their tongue, urinate, or defecate. In contrast, an absence seizure presents as an acute disruption in awareness without a deeper loss of consciousness and usually occurs in children and youth. It can manifest as discreet signs such as blinking, slight twitching, or absent-mindedness. Absence seizures usually occur several times a day and can be triggered by quick breathing. Simple focal seizures involve muscle twitching that it limited to a specific area or sensations on the skin. Acoustic and visual sensitivity can also be symptoms of epilepsy. Patients often remain conscious. Complex focal seizures involve déjà vu phenomena, feeling of insubstantiality, hallucinations or even heart-racing and difficulty in breathing. The patient’s gaze becomes rigid, the patients perform chew- and lick-movements and produce retching sounds.","Name":"Epileptic seizures","PossibleSymptoms":"Tremor at rest,Unconsciousness, short,Cramps,Uncontrolled defecation,Disorientation regarding time or place,Feeling faint,Morning stiffness,Absence of a pulse,Blue colored skin","ProfName":"Epilepsy","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"If the patient can’t recover between two seizures, they can develop a so-called Status epilepticus. This is dangerous, because the disrupted breathing can cause an undersupply of the vital organs as well as the brain. Antiepileptic medication is used for therapy. Patients should avoid provocation factors such as excessive consumption of alcohol. After two years without any seizure, the medication may be discontinued."}
