{"Description":"Bulges in the wall of the aorta cause aneurysms of a size up to several centimetres. The bigger an aneurysm, the greater the danger of rupturing. The rupture leads to a severe loss of blood (for example in the abdomen), and often help comes too late.","DescriptionShort":"An aortic aneurysm is a bulging section in the wall of the aorta. These bulges can occur anywhere along the aorta, but are most commonly found in the abdomen. ","MedicalCondition":"Aortic aneurysms can generally occur anywhere along the aorta, but they are most common in the abdomen. Men are affected more often than women. Up to 50% of all cases are detected during an ultrasound or a CT scan, often at a point of time when no or only unspecific symptoms could be observed. The most common symptoms are unspecific, such as back pain, digestion problems or abdominal pain, sometimes also irritations of nerves or thrombosis, if the bulge presses on nerves or blood vessels. After a rupture, patients describe strongest pain in abdomen, back or chest, quickly followed by shock.","Name":"Aneurysm of the main artery","PossibleSymptoms":"Abdominal pain,Chest pain,Dizziness,Paralysis,Shortness of breath,Back pain,Unconsciousness, short,Side pain,Palpitations,Feeling faint,Difficulty in swallowing,Absence of a pulse,Hoarseness,Blackening of vision","ProfName":"Aortic aneurysm","Synonyms":"Excessive enlargement of the aorta,Aneurysm of the aorta,Aneurism of the aorta,Aneurism of the main artery","TreatmentDescription":"Aortic aneurysms discovered by chance are measured and observed. Often, the bulge is filled with clotted blood (thrombosis). Small particles can tear from this thrombosis, block a smaller vessel behind (embolism) and lead to impaired blood circulation. If the aneurysm reaches a certain size, the risk of a spontaneous rupture is too big, so that the bulge should be treated surgically, if the patientâ€™s condition allows. In most cases, stents will be implanted. "}
