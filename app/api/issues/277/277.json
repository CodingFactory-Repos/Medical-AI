{"Description":"Coagulopathy is used as an umbrella term for a range of conditions that lead to an impaired blood-clotting. This condition can cause spontaneous haemorrhages, e.g. into the skin or the joints, or increased loss of blood even in the event of minor injuries.","DescriptionShort":"Coagulopathy is a disorder that interrupts or disrupts the formation of blood clots. This can cause impacted patients to lose a lot of blood even after small injuries.","MedicalCondition":"There are coagulopathies that are primarily caused by a loss of function or a lack of clotting factors, and coagulopathies caused by antibodies against clotting factors, triggered by an excessive usage of clotting factors (disseminated intravascular coagulation) or that lead to bleedings caused by excessive activity of clotting factors’ antagonists. Haemophilia A or B and the Willebrand disease belong to the group of congenital diseases that cause loss of function of single clotting factors. Some conditions require medication that leads to a lack of functioning clotting factors, such as Marcumar or Aspirin; it is then called acquired coagulopathy. Antibodies against clotting factors can occur spontaneously, but more often they appear in combination with other systemic diseases, e.g.  systemic lupus erythematosus. Surgeries, for example of the lung, uterus or prostrate or genetic effects (lack of alpha-2-antiplasmin) can cause a stronger activity of clotting factors’ antagonists.","Name":"Bleeding disorder","PossibleSymptoms":"Blue spot on skin,Back pain,Joint swelling,Joint pain,Unconsciousness, short,Nosebleed,Eye redness,Joint redness","ProfName":"Coagulopathy","Synonyms":"Clotting disorder","TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of coagulopathy strongly depends on the underlying disease. They may include the following; however, those treatments can’t be applied in all cases: providing clotting factors, substantial haemostasis and diligent sutures after injuries, medication, change of dosage of e.g. Marcumar or Aspirin, transfusion of blood platelets. Absence of measures that carry a high risk of bleeding, such as intramuscular injections. In any case, coagulopathy should be treated by a specialist."}
