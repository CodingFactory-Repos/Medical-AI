{"Description":"Aortic valve stenosis describes an obstruction of the heart ventricular flow which is caused by a narrowing of the outflow tract of the heart. Because of this narrowing, the valve is unable to open itself completely and this makes it hard for the blood to flow from the heart into the aorta and to other parts of the body. This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This again makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe cases, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it. Without treatment, the narrowing of the aortic valve can cause severe complications for the heart.","DescriptionShort":"Aortic valve stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve located between the left heart chamber and the aorta. It often goes unnoticed for a long time until it becomes apparent through shortness of breath, chest pains, or loss of consciousness after effort.","MedicalCondition":"Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valvular defect and occurs predominantly with increased age. Minor cases of aortic valve stenosis does not usually cause any discomfort. It isn’t until the valvular opening is so small that the heart can no longer pump enough blood efficiently through the valve, that complaints starts to appear, like shortness of breath, chest pain, or sudden loss of consciousness.","Name":"Narrowing of the aortic valve","PossibleSymptoms":"Shortness of breath,Unconsciousness, short,Chest pain,Night cough,Blackening of vision,Dizziness,Palpitations,Pallor,Tiredness,Absence of a pulse,Heart murmur,Irregular heartbeat,Feeling faint","ProfName":"Aortic stenosis","Synonyms":"AS,Aortic valve stenosis","TreatmentDescription":"People with aortic valve stenosis should get regular medical check ups. When no complaints are immediately obvious, then generally no treatment is necessary. The occurrence of the above mentioned symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pains or sudden loss of consciousness indicate a serious case of aortic valve stenosis. In such cases one should take it easy and consider a surgery for the installation of an artificial aortic valve so that the heart doesn’t become damaged over time from being overworked."}
