{"Description":"Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints (arthritis), which can cause swelling between the vertebrae and cause some parts of the spine to fuse together. As a result, the spine will become painful, less flexible and stiff. It often results in a hunchback. Like many other arthritis forms, it is an autoimmune disease.","DescriptionShort":"Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammation that causes arthritis in the spine. It can cause swelling between the vertebrae. Though it cannot be cured, treatments can still improve the symptoms.","MedicalCondition":"Ankylosing spondylitis is an autoimmune disease, which means that the immune system attacks its own body parts. The exact cause of this in turn is not well known. However, it is believed that genes and the environment may have an impact. The gene known as HLA-B27 is thought to be associated with susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis. People with the gene HLA-B27 are more likely to have the problem, but by far not all people with the gene will get ankylosing spondylitis. People with ankylosing spondylitis often experience symptoms such as stiffness and pain of the lower back. This especially occurs in the morning and at rest. In some cases it may even result in a hunchback. The start of the disease is mostly in puberty or in early adolescence. The most commonly affected areas include the joint between the base of the spine and pelvis (sacroiliac joint), the lower vertebrae, the places of insertion where the tendons and ligaments attach to bones, the cartilage between the breastbone and ribs, and joints of the hip and shoulder.","Name":"Bekhterev's disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Back pain,Eye redness,Morning stiffness,Limited mobility of the back","ProfName":"Ankylosing spondylitis","Synonyms":"AS,Bechterew's disease,Bechterew's syndrom,Marie-Str√ºmpell disease","TreatmentDescription":"Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatment can clearly reduce the symptoms. Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve the pain, stiffness and inflammation. Recent medications, which prevent autoimmune inflammations, such as Etanercept and Adalimumab can be used in more severe cases. Additionally, a doctor may refer the patient to a physical therapist. Physical therapy can help patients with pain relief and even the improvement of physical strength and flexibility. In some cases, surgery may be considered to improve the symptoms."}
