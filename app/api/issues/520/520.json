{"Description":"The burning muscle pain occurring several hours after heavy muscle work is considered as muscle soreness. Nowadays it is supposed that these pains develop due to small injuries in the muscle fibrils, the contracting elements of a muscle cell.","DescriptionShort":"Muscle soreness describes pain in the muscles that appears several hours after intense muscle work and lasts for few days. The reason for this is most likely the appearance of small injuries (micro traumata) in the motoric structures of the muscle fibers during overstressing. The relieving factors for muscle soreness include medication, mild massages and local warming.","MedicalCondition":"On the cause of muscle soreness is not yet fully agreed. The theory of accumulation of lactic acid being responsible for pain seems disproven since the amount of pain does not correlate with the amount of lactic acid. Furthermore, at the time the pain occurs, the accumulated lactic acid is already degraded for the most part. More probable seems that small injuries (micro traumata) in the z-line of the muscular fibrils are responsible for muscle soreness. Due to these injuries the muscle cells start to swell and to build inflammatory substances. Because there are no nerve endings in a muscle fiber, the injury cannot be felt at the time of their incidence. But now, when the swelling goes back and the inflammatory substances are flushed out, the nerves get in contact with these substances and start to signalize pain. This happens about 12-24 hours after overstressing.","Name":"Muscle soreness","PossibleSymptoms":"Muscle pain,Pain in the calves,Tremor on movement,Limited mobility of the leg,Physical inactivity,Difficulty with gait,Arm pain,Leg pain","ProfName":"Delayed onset muscle soreness","Synonyms":"Sore muscles,Stiffness after exertion,Aching muscles,Muscle ache,Muscle fever","TreatmentDescription":"The relieving factors for muscle soreness are mainly medications, physical therapies and heat application. Medications such as painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve the discomforts that muscle soreness brings. Physical therapies, such as mild massages of affected muscles, and heat application, such as warm packing or a warm bath, will stimulate the blood circulation and therefore accelerate the process of healing."}
