{"Description":"The wall of the large intestine has certain areas that are susceptible to the formation of pouches (diverticula) that bulge into the abdominal cavity. This condition is known in the medical field as diverticulosis. Diverticulosis does not cause any ailments and for this reason it usually goes unnoticed. The diverticula are usually discovered during a colonoscopy. If the diverticula become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis.","DescriptionShort":"Diverticulosis is the development of outpocketings in the wall of the large intestine into the abdominal cavity.  These are often found in the sigmoid (pelvic) colon.  Diverticulosis in itself does not cause ailments.  However, if the outpocketing becomes inflamed, known as diverticulitis, then sharp pains may occur.  Diverticulitis can reoccur and lead to serious problems.","MedicalCondition":"The disease is widespread in the Western world in contrast to other parts of the world. Because of this, it’s thought that there is a relationship between Western diet, poor in fiber and rich in fats, and the disease. This type of diet means that food remains in the intestines longer, which creates an increase in pressure in the intestines, which leads to the creation of pouches (diverticula) in weak spots. Inflammation of these diverticula causes sharp pains that are usually felt in the left side of the lower abdomen. Fever and illness can occur. In rare cases it can lead to an ileus (disruption of bowel movement), a perforation of the intestines, or bleeding. Sudden, sharp stomach aches and vomiting constitute an emergency situation.","Name":"Diverticular disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Difficult defecation,Abdominal pain,Blood in stool,Less than 3 defecations per week","ProfName":"Diverticulosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"If a recurring inflammation results in the perforation of the intestine, exposing the abdominal cavity to infection or if obstruction of bowel movements (ileus) develops, then an operation must be carried out quickly. Generally, diverticulitis can be treated with antibiotics and pain medication. However, recurrence of symptoms becomes problematic when they interfere with the patient’s quality of life and limit the patient’s abilities. In cases such as this, surgical removal of the affected part of the intestine can be considered an option. Patients are generally symptom-free after the operation."}
