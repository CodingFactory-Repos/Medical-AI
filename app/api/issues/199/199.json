{"Description":"A bacterial skin infection results from skin that has been wounded, scraped or cut open. This opening in the body's natural barrier allows bacteria to enter and multiply, leading to infections.","DescriptionShort":"A bacterial skin infection is an infection of the skin caused by a specific bacteria. The symptoms will depend upon the kind of infection, and may be minor or severe. Treatment often includes antibiotics.","MedicalCondition":"Although bacteria can often live on the skin without causing an infection, the risk of getting a bacterial skin infection becomes much higher when the skin is broken. People who have certain medical conditions including diabetes, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or skin damage from sunburn or any eczema are also more likely to be at risk. Many different types of bacteria can enter through the skin, but Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are the most common. Common bacterial skin infections include: 1) cellulitis: this condition forms deep within the skin's layers and can cause the skin to swell, turn red and be warm and tender, 2) folliculitis: it forms with small, white lumps around the hair follicles, 3) impetigo: a superficial skin infection that usually starts with sores around the nose or mouth and lead to honey-like looking crusts, 4) boils and carbuncles: they begin as red lumps (such as a folliculitis) that grow larger and fill with pus before breaking open and draining. The symptoms of bacterial skin infection can be mild or life-threatening.","Name":"Bacterial skin infection","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin redness,Non-healing skin wound,Wound,Facial swelling,Arm swelling,Leg swelling,Skin rash,Fever,Swollen glands in the groin,Nausea,Vomiting,Headache,Pain in the limbs,Swollen glands in the neck,Swollen glands in the armpit,Foot swelling,Toe swelling,Arm pain,Leg pain,Pain radiating to the arm,Hand pain,Knee pain,Elbow pain","ProfName":"Skin infection, bacterial","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Minor bacterial skin infections may resolve spontaneously without treatment (such as impetigo and folliculitis). Serious and persistent bacterial infections are usually treated with antibiotics (cellulitis and boils). The types of antibiotics which are used include topical creams and oral medication or injections. Before commencing antibiotics it is recommended that samples are taken in order to determine which organism is responsible for the infection and whether or not they have any antibiotic resistance. If the infection is serious, immediate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic may be indicated. Once the specific organism that has caused the infection has been determined, the broad-spectrum antibiotic may be replaced by a specific antibiotic that is directed against the particular organism."}
