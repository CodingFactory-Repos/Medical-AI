{"Description":"Astigmatism is a problem of the optical system of the eye that causes blurred vision due to either the irregular shape of the cornea or the abnormal curvature of the lens inside the eye. An irregular shape of cornea or lens prevents light from focusing properly on the retina. As a result, vision becomes blurred at any distance.","DescriptionShort":"Astigmatism is a visual problem that causes blurred vision. It happens when there is a refractive error in the cornea or lens in the form of irregular refractive power. It is recommended to visit an oculist. A pair of glasses, lenses or a proper eye laser surgery can solve the problem.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of astigmatism are mainly an irregular shape of the cornea or an abnormal curvature of the lens. Once the shape of the cornea or the lens becomes irregular, the light cannot be bundled in a single point and will therefore not focus properly on the retinal. As a result, it will lead to a blurred vision at any distance. Astigmatism can be either congenital or acquired. A congenital astigmatism is present from birth, and often comes together with other problems in the optic system such as farsightedness or nearsightedness. An acquired astigmatism can occur due to a disease of the cornea or after an eye surgery, for example, cataract surgery.","Name":"Corneal distorsion","PossibleSymptoms":"Vision impairment,Blurred vision","ProfName":"Astigmatism","Synonyms":"Warping of the cornea,Corneal curvature","TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of astigmatism include a proper pair of glasses, lenses and eye laser surgery. A customized pair of glasses or individually adapted lenses can compensate the irregularities in the optic system and help to adjust the light to focus properly on the retina. Nearsightedness or farsightedness can be adjusted at the same time. Up to a certain degree of severity, these adjustments can also be achieved with eye laser surgery. In this case the shape of the cornea will be modified in order to compensate for the refraction error. After all, make sure to discuss the possibilities of treatment with an oculist."}
