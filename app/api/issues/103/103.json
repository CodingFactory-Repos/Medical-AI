{"Description":"A herniated disc (also known as a slipped disc or spinal disc herniation) is when a disc bulges out between the vertebrae of the spinal cord and presses against the spinal cord nerve.  Spinal discs lose elasticity with age and can tear with sudden, awkward movements while carrying heavy loads (e.g. lifting heavy weights with a bent back) and then bulge out into the spinal canal.  This compresses the spinal nerve root.  The lumbar vertebrae are usually the ones affected (technically known at L5\/S1, L4\/L5)","DescriptionShort":"A herniated disc (or a slipped disc) is a medical condition in which a part of the disc between the vertebrae of the spine protrudes out and puts pressure on the nerve of the spinal cord. This causes a radiating pain.","MedicalCondition":"Patients usually feel pain in the lumbar vertebrae after a clumsy movement. The pain then spreads to the buttocks, then the upper thigh, and can even radiate down the entire leg. In serious cases, patients may experience lack of sensation or even paralysis.","Name":"Slipped disc","PossibleSymptoms":"Limited mobility of the back,Numbness of the hands,Pain in the limbs,Tingling,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Neck pain,Back pain,Pain radiating to the leg,Pain radiating to the arm,Numbness in the arm,Numbness in the leg,Lower-back pain,Immobilization,Uncontrolled defecation,Limited mobility of the leg,Leg pain,Neck stiffness","ProfName":"Spinal disc herniation","Synonyms":"Disc herniation","TreatmentDescription":"After having the herniated disc confirmed through special imaging (MRI, magnetic resonance imaging), pain medication and bed rest can help to reduce pain. Heat therapy and massage can also help to loosen up the muscles around the herniated disc. To prevent recurrence, behavioral training (\"back school\") is recommended. In more severe cases, where a sense of failure or even paralysis is present, surgery is required."}
