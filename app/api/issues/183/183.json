{"Description":"Accidents, infections or genetic illnesses can cause the vascular wall’s inner layer to tear. The high blood pressure pushes the blood between the layers, where it pushes forward. This can lead to other arteries being blocked, so that some organs aren’t sufficiently supplied with oxygen. This makes an aortic dissection so dangerous. For example a blockage of the large, brain-supplying vessels can cause strokes or even brain death.","DescriptionShort":"An aortic dissection occurs when the vascular wall’s innermost layer tears, due to various reasons. Blood can then get between the layers and push forward until it reaches the normal vessel again.","MedicalCondition":"Patients suffering from an aortic dissection experience acute and severe pain. If the dissection occurs in the chest, the pain will be mainly behind the sternum or between the shoulder blades; sometimes it might radiate to the left arm or throat and can be mistaken for a heart-attack. Afterwards, there will be symptoms caused by the organs or body parts affected by the reduced supply. The closer to the heart the dissection occurs (in the ascending aorta), the higher is the risk of a pericardial tamponade and cardiac arrest.","Name":"Dissection of the aorta","PossibleSymptoms":"Shortness of breath,Abdominal pain,Chest pain,Back pain,Paralysis,Dizziness,Unconsciousness, short,Vision impairment,Cold sweats,Absence of a pulse,Feeling faint,Disorientation regarding time or place,Palpitations","ProfName":"Aortic dissection","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"An aortic dissection is a dangerous condition that needs to be treated as an emergency, or at least observed in intensive care, depending on its location. A surgery is not always necessary, in some cases lowering of blood pressure or pain therapy can be sufficient."}
