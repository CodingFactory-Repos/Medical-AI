{"Description":"Kyphosis is a condition of the spine with forward bowing or rounding of the back, which can lead to a hunchback or forward slouching posture. Scheuermann’s disease is a condition where the vertebrae grow unevenly leading to a kyphosis. It is much more common in boys than in girls.","DescriptionShort":"Scheuermann’s disease describes a disorder of the spine growth in children that leads to exaggerated rounding of the back (kyphosis). The treatment will depend on the condition. Normally it may include medication to reduce the pain, orthosis to support regular growth and surgery to improve the deformity and physical therapy.","MedicalCondition":"Scheuermann’s disease occurs when the vertebrae in the upper back become more wedge-shaped due to less growth in the anterior parts of the vertebra than in the posterior. It is the most common cause of kyphosis found in male teenagers. The cause of Scheuermann’s disease is the uneven physical stress on the vertebrae which leads to damage in the anterior growth area. Besides, a kyphosis can also be caused by a variety of other problems including 1) fractures caused by osteoporosis, 2) disk degeneration, 3) birth defect, 4) cancer and tumors, and 5) injuries. Along with a hunchback, people with kyphosis may have symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, fatigue, mild back pain, tenderness and stiffness in the spine.","Name":"Scheuermann's disease","PossibleSymptoms":"Curvature of the spine,Back pain,Back deformity,Lower-back pain,Limited mobility of the back","ProfName":"Scheuermann's kyphosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatments of a kyphosis are indicated not only to relieve pain but also to correct a cosmetic deformity that is not acceptable. The treatments should prevent potential progression or worsening of the curve. The treatment will depend on the cause. In case of Scheuermann’s kyphosis, the disease is self limiting with finished growth. However, the hunchback and the corresponding symptoms may stay and an early treatment therefore is recommended. The treatment includes physical therapy, orthosis (corset) and in severe cases even surgery. For other causes of kyphosis the treatment is as follows: if the disease is congenital, it will require surgery at an early age. If the disease is caused by osteoporosis, then the underlying disease should be treated. Some cases will need surgery to improve the debilitating deformity, and after surgery, a brace to support the back and physical therapy to regain the physical strength may be suggested."}
