{"Description":"Osteoporosis is a common disease. Various causes lead to the dissolving of body salts from the bones, and the bone becomes porous. It is characterized by a reduction in bone density, which leads to an increased risk of breaking bones throughout the entire skeleton. The most common fractures are the vertebrae, femur (nearest the hips), forearm (near the wrist), head of the humerus, and the pelvis.","DescriptionShort":"Osteoporosis is characterized by loss of bone substance of the whole body, thinning or shrinking the trabeculae. This leads to the bones becoming fragile, so that they break easier or spontaneously. Frequent fractures of e.g. vertebral bodies, thigh- or forearm bones can occur.","MedicalCondition":"Osteoporosis mainly affects elderly persons and, within this group, mainly women. Most common reason is a vitamin D deficiency; in women it is mainly hormonal changes after the menopause that causes calcium and phosphate to dissolve from the bone. The bone mass decreases, the bones are not as robust anymore and typical fractures and related pain occur. Spontaneous fractures (without any hit- or push-impact) most commonly occur in the vertebrae, but also in the pelvis or the forearm. Low bone-stability leads to frequent typical fractures that can occur either spontaneously or following slight traumata.","Name":"Thinning bones","PossibleSymptoms":"Bone fracture,Pain in the bones,Back pain,Neck pain","ProfName":"Osteoporosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Blood tests and bone density measurements with certain x-rays can help the doctor to diagnose osteoporosis. Besides tending to existing fractures, treatment will depend on the identified causes. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D as well as regular exercise are very important in the prevention and reduction of bone loss. Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), dried figs, almonds, sesame seeds, cod liver oil, salmon, and chicken eggs. Because vitamin D is produced predominantly after sun exposure in the skin and is not easily absorbed from digested foods, itâ€™s recommended that people from 65 years onwards use calcium and vitamin D dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. If the presence of osteoporosis is confirmed in a bone density test (a densitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA), treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be started immediately. Additionally, a class of medications called bisphosphonates may be used to stop further bone loss. Often intake of vitamin D and calcium can be sufficient, but sometimes more comprehensive measures may be necessary."}
