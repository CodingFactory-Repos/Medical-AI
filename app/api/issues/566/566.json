{"Description":"A vertebral fracture is a condition when there is bone broken in the spine. It is a very dangerous fracture due to possible damage to the spinal cord. Usually it is caused by accidents, traumas, osteoporosis, bone metastases and any condition that can weaken or damage the structure of the bones.","DescriptionShort":"A vertebral fracture is a condition which describes a fracture occurring in the spine. This kind of fracture often results from an accident or bone-related diseases. When a vertebral fracture occurs, it is necessary to consult a doctor immediately. Beside stable fractures of the vertebral body, vertebral fractures will usually need spinal surgery.","MedicalCondition":"The causes of a vertebral fracture include accidents and traumas, such as car or motorbike accidents, a fall from a great height, sports injuries, violent impacts and any other condition that can damage the spinal bones. However, not only accidents and traumas can result in a vertebral fracture, but also bone-related disease such as osteoporosis and bone tumors, especially bone metastases. These kinds of diseases can weaken and damage the structure of the spinal bones and therefore cause or promote fractures. People with a vertebral fracture can experience symptoms like 1) sudden pain of the back, 2) worsening of pain during standing or walking, 3) relief of pain during lying on the back, 4) limitations of spinal movements, 5) height loss, and even 6) deformity and 7) paralyses and loss of sensitivity (paraplegia or quadriplegia).","Name":"Vertebral fracture","PossibleSymptoms":"Back pain,Numbness in the leg,Muscle weakness,Lower-back pain,Immobilization,Curvature of the spine,Delayed start to urination,Bone fracture,Back deformity,Paralysis,Limited mobility of the back","ProfName":"Vertebral body fracture","Synonyms":"Spinal fracture,Spine fracture","TreatmentDescription":"If a vertebral fracture is diagnosed the treatment depends on: 1) the cause of a vertebral fracture, for example, a fracture caused by a trauma or by a disease, 2) the particular fracture pattern. If the fracture is caused by a disease, then besides the fracture, the underlying disease should also be treated. If it is caused by an accident, it is important to avoid moving the patient in order to prevent further damage on the spinal cord. Medications such as steroids and painkillers can reduce the discomfort. A stable fracture can be treated conservatively with rest and immobilization. However, surgery is often necessary to repair the bones and avoid damage on the spinal cord."}
