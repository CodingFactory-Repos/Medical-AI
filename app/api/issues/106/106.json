{"Description":"The mumps is a viral infection, also called parotitis in medical terms and is particularly common in colder seasons. As a rule the person with the disease is isolated for one week after the disease starts. However, the disease can still become occasionally epidemic locally among children who are not vaccinated. Also it appears in various cases which are then not connected. Children between the age of 4 and 15 are often affected by mumps. A vaccine for the infection was used for the first time in 1967. Since then, the incidence of mumps had been reduced dramatically. Measles or chickenpox are more infectious than mumps and adults who are not vaccinated are more likely to experience complications than children. However, mumps causes rarely serious issues. The disease is highly contagious since the airborne droplets transmit the virus.","DescriptionShort":"Mumps is an infection triggered by a virus in the salivary glands. In particular the parotid glands are attacked. These glands are located under each ear and on each side of the mouth. Mumps presents itself through painful and swollen cheeks. A vaccination against the mumps is available.","MedicalCondition":"About a third of those affected show no signs of the disease. The rest of the cases experience first fever, fatigue, and head, throat, or ear aches. This is followed by the typical painful swelling of the cheeks due to an inflammation of the salivary glands. In rare cases an infection of the pancreas, testicles, or meninges may develop. Hearing difficulties may also result from the illness.","Name":"Inflammation of the parotid gland","PossibleSymptoms":"Cheek swelling,Earache,Fever,Headache,Mouth pain,Sore throat,Facial swelling,Swelling of the testicles,Pain when chewing","ProfName":"Mumps","Synonyms":"Inflammation of the parotid gland","TreatmentDescription":"It is recommended that you get vaccinated against mumps as way of prevention. Vaccination for mumps requires two shots: the first at 12 months and the second at 15-24 months. The vaccination is combined with others and covers measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). If mumps breaks out, fever-lowering drugs and painkillers, warm compresses and liquid food products usually help easing the pain. If the child's condition deteriorates, a doctor should definitely be consulted to detect and treat possible complications."}
