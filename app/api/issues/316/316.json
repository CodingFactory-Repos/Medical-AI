{"Description":"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that attacks the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells. A misguided immune system will destroy the myelin sheath that surrounds and protects the nerve cells, and lead to focus of inflammation and later a scar on the affected nerve cells. This causes a variety of symptoms depending on the affected area in the central nervous system. Common symptoms are restrictions in movements, sensibility and sight.","DescriptionShort":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that attacks the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells. Though it cannot be totally cured, treatments such as medication, physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy can help to control the symptoms and prevent fast progression of the disease.","MedicalCondition":"The exact cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. However, the causes may be related to genetic problems, viral infections or environmental factors. Once the autoimmune system starts to attack the myelin sheath, it will lead to a focus of inflammation and may leave scars on the affected areas. The inflammations can occur everywhere in the nerve fibers of the central nervous system (white matter) either in the brain or spinal cord. All Symptoms are the result of a nerve failure caused by a focus of inflammation and are therefore as various as the locations of these foci. An often seen but not necessary first symptom is the loss of sight on one eye due to an inflammation of the optical nerve (neuritis nervi optici). Multiple sclerosis may among others lead to symptoms such as abnormal movements, thoughts, and sensations. For example, people with MS often suffer from weakness of the muscles and show a handicap in movement such as abnormal walking patterns or inability to walk. Other symptoms are numbness, tingling sensations, coordination problems, imbalance, memory problems and changes in personality, fatigue, loss of bladder or bowel control.","Name":"Disseminated sclerosis","PossibleSymptoms":"Double vision,Double vision, acute-onset,Paralysis,Tiredness,Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Tremor on movement,Dizziness,Weakness or numbness on right or left side of body,Muscle weakness,Limited mobility of the leg,Face pain,Difficulty with gait,Problems with the sense of touch in the feet,Problems with the sense of touch in the face,Difficult defecation,Less than 3 defecations per week","ProfName":"Multiple sclerosis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of multiple sclerosis is mainly to control the inflammations and to improve symptoms. It cannot be totally cured. An acute inflammation is treated with a high dose steroid therapy. To prevent further episodes, medications for immunoregulation or immunosuppression are used. These medications need to be taken in advance and mostly for lifetime. Besides medication, the treatments include physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. A combination of these therapies can help to control the symptoms as well as to arrest the process of the disease."}
