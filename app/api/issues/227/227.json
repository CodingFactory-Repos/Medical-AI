{"Description":"Ectropion is a condition which majorly impacts the lower eyelid to droop and turn towards outward. It may affect only one but also both eyes. In severe cases, the whole eyelid surface is turned out while in less severe case, just one eyelid segment droops away from the affected eye. If a severe case is not treated, a corneal ulcer may develop and can affect the affected person's vision, however this is rare. An ectropion occurs more often with older adults when the lid muscles are no longer strong enough or as a result of a stroke in which the facial nerves have been affected.","DescriptionShort":"Ectropion is when the lower eyelid turns outward and droops away from the eye, usually with old age due to loss of strength in the musculature of the eyes. It is usually not a serious condition, but can be quite uncomfortable.","MedicalCondition":"Ageing is in most cases the cause of ectropion. It usually occurs as the muscles and tissue of the eyelids become weaker with age. Other causes are less common and they include tumor, cyst or lump on the eyelid, an issue with the nerves that control the eyelid, damage to the skin around the eyelid as a result of a previous surgery, contact dermatitis, burn, or an injury. In rare cases, if the muscles beneath the eyelid do not develop correctly, ectropion can be present from birth. Symptoms of ectropion include chronic conjunctivitis or pink eye, redness, burning, irritation, excessive dryness, and excessive tearing. Delay in treating can result in additional symptoms such as decreased vision, quick increase in redness of eyes, eye pain, and sudden sensitivity to light.","Name":"Eversion of the eyelid","PossibleSymptoms":"Burning eyes,Itching eyes,Eye redness,Tears","ProfName":"Ectropion","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of ectropion will be customized based on the underlying cause and its severity. Mild cases of ectropion may not need any treatment. If the symptoms are minor, a doctor or ophthalmologist can advise the affected person about ways to take care of the eyes and relieve the symptoms at home. Lubricating drops can protect the cornea from further damage and provide relief while awaiting treatment. Inappropriate wiping of the affected eye can make the condition to become worse. It is recommended to always use an ‘up and in’ movement to wipe the eyes from the outer up to the nose. In more severe cases, a surgery may be recommended to correct the issue."}
