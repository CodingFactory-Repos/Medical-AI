{"Description":"A sepsis is an initially local infection that develops into a generalised infection that spreads the infection-causing germs (most commonly E.coli, S.aureus, pneumococci) throughout the whole body. This spreading and the immune system’s response can cause partly life-threatening complications (shock, failure of single or multiple organs) that require intensive care.","DescriptionShort":"Sepsis is the medical term for blood poisoning. It describes an infection where bacteria spread via the blood throughout the body and cause severe symptoms up to organ failure.","MedicalCondition":"The blood poisoning’s symptoms determine the severeness of the condition. In case of a sepsis the patients are suffering from an infection. They have fever or even insufficient temperature (below 36°C), accelerated aspiration with hyperventilation, as well as characteristic changes to the haemogram. Severe sepsis also includes the following symptoms: confusion, diminished responsiveness, unrest or delirium, impaired blood-clotting, further restrictions to the gas exchange as well as impairment of kidney function define a severe sepsis. If the blood-pressure drops and can’t be stabilized with infusions it is a septic shock.","Name":"Blood poisoning","PossibleSymptoms":"Vomiting,Fever,Disorientation regarding time or place,Tiredness,Pain in the limbs,Palpitations,Shortness of breath,Cold hands","ProfName":"Sepsis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Patients with a sepsis definitely need antibiotic therapy, usually intravenous in the hospital, often even initially in intensive care. If possible, the source of infection should be treated. All other measures depend on the patient’s symptoms. Infusions or organ replacement therapies (e.g. dialysis in case of kidney failure) are possible and often necessary at short notice. Despite intensive therapy the mortality rate of sepsis is 55% and even 60% for those with septic shock."}
