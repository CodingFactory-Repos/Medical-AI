{"Description":"Lung cancer (or carcinoma of the lung) is a malignant form of cancer. Smoking tobacco products is the leading cause, which leads to irritation of the mucus membrane in the bronchial tubes. Long term irritation can lead to the degeneration of the bronchial cells. Exposure to asbestos as well as genetic factors can also aid the development of lung cancer, but these are much more rare. There are various kinds of lung cancer, but the most common are squamos-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. An especially aggressive form of lung cancer is small-cell lung carcinoma, which spreads to other organs early on (metastasis) and grows quickly. Depending on its spread and if it has affected the lymph nodes, lung cancer is divided into different stages of development, which determines the corresponding treatment.","DescriptionShort":"Lung cancer is a cancer that starts in the lungs and is malignant. The lungs are located in the chest as two spongy organs that swallow oxygen when a person inhales and let out carbon dioxide when that person exhales. The disease kills many people every year, more than do breast, ovarian, colon, and prostate cancers together. It represents the most common cause of death by cancer in men and the third most common in women.","MedicalCondition":"Mostly men, but increasingly women of advanced age, are affected by lung cancer. Few symptoms show in the early stage, but the patient may experience coughing, shortness of breath, or feel chest pain. Coughing blood, damage to the nervous system, accumulation of fluids in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and joint pain (via bone metastasis) are symptoms that occur in the advanced stage.","Name":"Lung cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Cough,Sputum,Bloody cough,Weight loss,Swollen glands in the armpit,Shortness of breath,Reduced appetite,Vomiting blood,Arm swelling,Hoarseness,Chest pain,Pain radiating to the arm,Chest tightness","ProfName":"Lung carcinoma","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Depending on the extent of the disease, patients may be able to recover in the early stages and have all of the tumor removed. The rate of recovery in the advanced stages are poor. Crucial factors to treatment and prognosis include the exact type of cancer, how far it has spread, and the general state of the patientâ€™s health. Chemotherapy or radiation are used against advanced stages of lung carcinoma."}
