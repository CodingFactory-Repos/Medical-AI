{"Description":"Triggered by an elongation or narrowing of the foreskin, some boys or men may experience a condition where the foreskin can’t be pulled back or is even so narrow, that it forms a “balloon” while urinating that will empty very slowly. Phimosis can cause pain when the patient has an erection and people affected by the condition are highly exposed to an inflammation of their glands. Such inflammation is called balanitis and they are at high risk of other complications. There are two forms of phimosis, pathologic and physiologic.","DescriptionShort":"A phimosis or narrowing of foreskin describes a condition in boys or men, when the foreskin of the penis can’t be pulled back over the gland at all or if it is painful to do so, or if the foreskin is so narrow that even urinating becomes difficult. The foreskin can form a \"balloon\" when urinating, which makes the urination very slow and cumbersome.","MedicalCondition":"Physiologic phimosis is a condition that is present since birth. We are talking about a physiologic situation, when the foreskin cannot be pulled back in young children and is not painful either. In most cases, this situation resolves itself when the child is around seven or sixteen years old and does not need treatment. People should not try to tug back the foreskin when the child is still young. Although pathologic phimosis is rare, the reason for it is not always clear. An underlying medical condition like scarring or balanitis as well as some other risk factors can cause it. When the patient is unable to pull back the foreskin, it can be difficult for him to clean the area and this can trigger balanitis because of bacteria that might be trapped beneath the foreskin, which can lead to an inflammation. This can also cause pain, especially during manipulations. It can be difficult for the patient to urinate. The erection and urination can be painful and the patient can have also paraphimosis.","Name":"Narrowing of foreskin","PossibleSymptoms":"Swelling in the genital area,Swelling of the testicles,Dribbling after urination,Painful urination","ProfName":"Phimosis","Synonyms":"Contraction of foreskin,Stricture of foreskin","TreatmentDescription":"Most patients can be treated by applying certain ointments for the duration of approximately 4 weeks. If the result is not satisfactory, or if the foreskin is too narrow, a circumcision can be considered."}
