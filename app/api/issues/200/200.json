{"Description":"Basal cell carcinoma is a skin tumor, occurring 90% of the cases on the face. It can also develop on other parts of the body, but rarely. It originates from cells surrounding the hair root, which is why it never develops on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet.","DescriptionShort":"Basal cell carcinoma is the most frequent type of skin cancer. It predominantly affects the face, but can also develop elsewhere on the body, except for on the inner palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet. This kind of tumor grows relatively slowly, but like other tumors, it destroys surrounding tissue. The tumor can be removed by surgery and in most cases it can be cured.","MedicalCondition":"People with light skin who often spend considerable amounts of time under direct sunlight unprotected and whose family has a history of basal cell carcinoma are especially having a higher risk. In the majority of cases, the first symptom is a nodule (nodular basal-cell carcinoma), which has a pearl-like shine and is surrounded or lined by small blood vessels. This nodule grows slowly outward and deeper into the skin and bleeding can occur. Nodules can disrupt, giving an ulcer-like appearance. Other, very rare forms of basal cell carcinoma can be brownish (pigmented carcinoma), contain fluids (cystic carcinoma), or may be smooth and reddened (superficial carcinoma). Basal-cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that rarely metastasizes, but which can heavily destroy surrounding tissue with its growth and can cause serious complications. It may, for example, destroy bone tissue and damage nerves.","Name":"White skin cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Skin thickening,Crusting,Non-healing skin wound,Skin nodules","ProfName":"Basal-cell carcinoma","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Basal-cell carcinoma can be surgically removed.  The treatment requires large areas of surrounding  tissue to be removed, to assure that all tumor is excised.  If an operation is not possible due to any number of reasons, another option is to treat the tumor with radiation.  This method is not as guaranteed as surgical removal and after several years the skin may show signs of radiation damage.  If you have basal-cell carcinoma, your doctor can talk to you about which method is the best for you.  Metastasis is very rare for basal-cell carcinoma.  After the tumor excision, relapse is possible, though not frequent.  Furthermore, the risk of developing basal-cell carcinoma in other parts of the body is increased by 50% after having a first tumor.  An annual checkup after the removal of a tumor is recommended for the purpose of identifying additional lesions."}
