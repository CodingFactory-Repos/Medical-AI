{"Description":"Eye injuries occur due to foreign bodies which enter the eye. There are numerous forms of eye injury such as exposure to radiation from sun lamps or the sun, exposure to chemical or cleaning products used at home, cutting or penetrating injuries from projectiles or glass, and foreign bodies such as little pieces of metal, wood, or grit. Other forms of eye injury include abrasions and scratches from tree branches, fingernails, a fist or a ball that reaches the eye badly. Wearing incorrectly contact lenses can also cause an eye injury. This is particularly the case if the lenses have been used for a longer period, do not fit correctly or are dirty.","DescriptionShort":"Eye injuries occur when foreign bodies enter the eye. The degree of injury should be determined by an eye doctor and treated. Eye injury occurs often while taking part in sports, at home, in the workplace, or from other situations. Injuries may affect different layers of the eye: superficial injuries affect just the cornea, whereas deep injuries affect the cornea and deeper layers.","MedicalCondition":"If the cornea has been injured, the patient will feel increasing pain with time. Redness of the eye also increases. These types of injuries often occur during grinding work when safety goggles are not worn. Deep eye injuries can occur during work with a hammer and chisel or when striking a hammer against stone and metal. Splinters can dismantle from the source material and enter the eye at high speeds (causing small, deep injuries). Deep eye injuries can also happen in the home (with scissors, knives, or other pointed instruments) or in the event that eyeglasses shatter (causing large, deep injuries). Patients usually notice small, deep injuries when they feel something hitting the eye and then experience a sudden impairment in vision. Because the cornea can heal itself quickly in the case of small injuries, such as a stone splinter, there is generally no loss of vitreous humor (fluid within the eye). In the case of large, deep injuries, the cornea remains torn, fluid spills out, the pupil changes its shape, and the lens becomes clouded. The eyeball weakens and can collapse.","Name":"Injury of the eye","PossibleSymptoms":"Burning eyes,Eye redness,Feeling of foreign body in the eye,Eye blinking,Tears","ProfName":"Eye injury","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"In the case of superficial injuries, the patient usually receives eye drops that numb the cornea so that the doctor can remove any foreign objects from the eye. Operation is usually necessary for most deep eye injuries in order to remove the object and to close the wound. Its possible that after these measures full vision is not restored. In cases of serious injury, blindness is a possible result."}
