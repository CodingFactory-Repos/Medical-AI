{"Description":"Corrosion of the eye is when acidic or basic substances have contact with the eye. Both kinds of substances can damage the cornea and, depending on the concentration, deeper layers of the eye. Generally, corrosion by a basic substance is more severe than acidic corrosion, but both cases are an ophthalmologic emergency, as they can lead to blindness.","DescriptionShort":"Eye corrosion can happen when the eye comes into contact with a vaporous, liquid, or solid chemical. The severity of eye burns depends on the chemical and the amount that comes into contact with the eye. The vast majority of burns are luckily treatable and cause just temporary discomfort. However an injury of the eye from chemical acids or bases should always be treated as an emergency that should be treated by a doctor immediately.","MedicalCondition":"When acids (such as cleaning agents, car batteries, or plant fluids and the like) or bases (such as drain pipe cleaners, cleaning agents, paints, or lime and the like) come into contact with the eye, the cornea becomes damaged and in the case of corrosive bases, other layers of the eye may be damaged. Patients complain of serious pains and cannot open the affected eye. A heavy flow of tears also sets in.","Name":"Chemical eye burn","PossibleSymptoms":"Burning eyes,Eye redness,Eye pain,Blurred vision,Eyelids sticking together","ProfName":"Eye corrosion","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Since even a small amount of corrosion can cause blindness in the affected eye, First Aid needs to be administered at the site of the accident. Someone should hold back the eyelids of the patient and clean the eye. Water can be used for this purpose.  Carbonated drinks or even beer can be used in the case of an alkali burn. Under absolutely no circumstances dairy products should be used! If there are still particles (such as calcium) in the eye, you can carefully use a cotton swab to remove it. The patient should visit an optometrist or eye clinic immediately. If possible, bring a package of the substance with you to the doctor. Itâ€™s also a good idea to continue washing the eye while on the way to the doctor. Your doctor will examine the eye and remove any particles still present. Depending on the degree of corrosion, the eye will be rinsed at regular intervals and, depending on the circumstances, eye drops may be administered, as well as pain killers. Long term treatment may be necessary in serious cases of corrosion."}
