{"Description":"Whiplash is a term that describes a lesion of the upper cervical spine due to acceleration-deceleration and overextension of the head that is usually the result of a car accident.","DescriptionShort":"Whiplash is the result of an acceleration-deceleration of the head and overextension of the neck without direct damage to the brain, skull, upper cervical spine, or spinal cord with symptoms lasting longer than 6 months. Symptoms generally disappear within 6 months following the trauma in about 90% of patients. It is yet unclear why 10% of patients continue to experience them.","MedicalCondition":"In the last 30 years, cases of whiplash have increased.  Affected patients suffer from dizziness, pain and paresthesia in the face and arms, become quickly exhausted, sleep disorders, problems of muscle function, troubles of attention, vision and hearing difficulties, and disorientation.","Name":"Whiplash","PossibleSymptoms":"Neck pain,Sleeplessness,Headache,Nausea,Pain radiating to the arm,Vomiting","ProfName":"Whiplash injury","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Whiplash can have devastating results, especially for social matters. Certain studies have shown that 7% of all people with whiplash were incapable of attending work long-term. Current therapy no longer recommends a neck brace but participation in an active physical therapy. Additionally, adequate  pain therapy and -if needed - muscle relaxant therapy should be considered, since an increased risk of lasting damage is possible without these treatments."}
