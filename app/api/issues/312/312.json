{"Description":"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the blood vessels, which supply blood to the head and the brain. The cause of this inflammation is an autoimmune reaction where the body's defense system is directed against itself. It mostly affects the large arteries, including the arteries near the temples (temporal artery), which is the reason why giant cell artiritis is also called temporal arteritis. Rarely also an inflammation of the eye vessels can occur.","DescriptionShort":"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It mostly affects the large arteries, including the temporal artery, which is the reason why patients often complain of pain in the front side of the head, in specific the temples. Rare but dangerous is an infestation in the eye vessels, which can lead to blindness.","MedicalCondition":"Giant cell arteritis usually occurs only in people over 50 years. It is often seen together with polymyalgia rheumatic (see polymyalgia rheumatic). However, both diseases can also occur separately. Very often giant cell arteritis affects the arteries around the temples, so that pain in this area is relatively common. Some of the arteries may also be thickened and nodules can be found in the temple area. In addition, patients often complain of a painful scalp, e.g. when combing hair, as well as pain in the cheek area when chewing. In addition, if vision problems occur, immediate clarification and treatment is absolutely necessary.","Name":"Giant cell arteritis","PossibleSymptoms":"Double vision,Double vision, acute-onset,Fever,Joint pain,Visual field loss,Weight loss,Pain in the limbs,Pain when chewing,Headache,Tiredness,Muscle pain,Vision impairment,Reduced appetite","ProfName":"Cranial arteritis","Synonyms":"GCA","TreatmentDescription":"If giant cell arteritis is not treated, it can lead to blindness if the ocular vessels are affected. The detection and treatment of this disease is crucial. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, complemented by some laboratory tests (so-called inflammatory markers) and a tissue sample, which is obtained from the temporal artery. If eye problems occur, high doses of cortisone are often used for a short period of time. A low dose of cortisone is prescribed for about one year to prevent a relapse."}
