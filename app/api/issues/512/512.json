{"Description":"Hip entrapment occurs when the acetabulum and femoral head rub against each other abnormally. Damage to the articular cartilage or labrum and limited range of motion can be the result.","DescriptionShort":"Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) describes painful bumping (impingement) of the femoral head and the acetabulum. It is the result of an abnormal shape of the femoral head, the acetabulum or both. It can cause pain and complicate hip movements. The treatment includes conservative and surgical therapies.","MedicalCondition":"The primary cause of femoroacetabular impingement is an abnormal shape of the femoral head or acetabulum. It is commonly classified into 3 forms including 1) cam impingement: this is a deformity of the ball-like shape of the femoral head. If the head is not shaped normally, the abnormal part of the head may jam in the socket (acetabulum) when the hip is bent, 2) pincer impingement: This is a deformity of the acetabulum. If the front rim of the acetabulum protrudes too far, the neck of the femur may collide with the rim of the acetabulum during normal hip movement, 3) mixed impingement: this is a deformity resulting in a combination of cam and pincer impingement. People with FAI may have symptoms such as pain in the groin or gluteal area. The symptoms can typically be triggered by climbing stairs, walking uphill and sitting for longer time. Commonly affected are children and adults who do a lot of sports.","Name":"Hip entrapment","PossibleSymptoms":"Limited mobility of the leg,Hip pain,Limited mobility of the hip","ProfName":"Femoroacetabular impingement","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of FAI may include either conservative or surgical treatment. Conservative treatments include 1) activity changes: avoiding activities that cause symptoms, 2) non-steroid anti-inflammation medication: they reduce the inflammation and pain, 3) physical therapy: this may help relieve stress on the injured labrum or cartilage. If the symptoms cannot be relieved by nonsurgical treatment, early surgical treatment should be considered. Especially in cases with minor deformations, surgery can be done minimally invasive with arthroscopy."}
