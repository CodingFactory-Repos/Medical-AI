{"Description":"Accident-related bone fractures can be a disruption in any part of human bones. The disruption results from accidents. The form of the fracture also depends on how the bones are broken.","DescriptionShort":"Accident-related bone fracture describes a fracture, which happens with a sudden accident. An accident-related bone fracture could occur in every part where a body has bones. Often it requires an emergency medical treatment or surgery. Later even a rehabilitation can be necessary.","MedicalCondition":"Accident-related bone fractures are a common consequence of car crashes or other unexpected accidents, which cause extreme force to be exerted on the bones. Serious broken bones injuries include pelvic fractures, fractures to the sternum or ribs, spine and skull fractures. A fracture of the forearm (Radius) is most frequently. Other common types of broken bone injuries include fractures of the ankle, femur, collarbone, and hand. Forms of fractures vary; in general they include 1) buckle or greenstick fracture (an incomplete fracture with intact periosteum on one side, which only occurs in children), 2) hairline\/stress fracture, 3) rotation fracture, 4) avulsion fracture, 5) oblique fracture, 6) comminuted fracture and 7) compound fracture.","Name":"Accident-related bone fracture of shoulder","PossibleSymptoms":"Bone fracture,Joint instability,Immobilization,Joint swelling,Joint pain,Blue spot on skin,Pain in the bones,Arm pain,Arm swelling","ProfName":"Bone trauma of shoulder","Synonyms":"Accident-related bone fracture","TreatmentDescription":"Treatment of accident-related fractures often requires surgery as the injuries often include multiple fractures or crush injuries and a high blood loss. Due to this, reconstructive surgery may be required. Most important is reconstruction of length, axis and rotation of the bone. Depending on what bones were broken, recovery could take a substantial amount of time, and rehabilitation may also be needed. Besides surgery, medication such as antibiotics (in open fractures) and analgesics can be considered for relieving pain or prevent bacterial infections."}
