{"Description":"The parathyroid glands are four small pea-shaped glands located on the boarders of the thyroid gland in the neck. They mainly produce the parathyroid hormone. The function of the parathyroid hormone includes the control of the level of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in the blood and bones. Hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is too much parathyroid hormone produced, which results in high level of calcium in the blood.","DescriptionShort":"Hyperparathyroidism describes a condition in which there is too much parathyroid hormone produced by the parathyroid glands. The causes of hyperparathyroidism are various. It is recommended to visit a doctor to clarify the cause and accept a proper treatment.","MedicalCondition":"Hyperparathyroidism can be classified in three different types according to its cause. 1) primary hyperparathyroidism: It is caused by an hyperplasia (abnormal mass) or a tumor in the parathyroid gland that produces parathyroid hormones autonomically. Women and people with family history will have higher risks of getting this problem. 2.) secondary hyperparathyroidism: It is the result of other  medical conditions such as kidney failure, disorders of liver or gut function, vitamin D deficiency and rickets. 3) tertiary hyperparathyroidism: it develops after years of a secondary hyperparathyroidism. The intake of lithium, a common medication for psychiatric disorders, can have a side effect that looks similar to a primary hyperparathyroidism. People with hyperparathyroidism usually have symptoms like pain in bones, vulnerability for fractures, increased amount of urine, kidney and bladder stones, fatigue and loss of appetite.","Name":"Overactivity of the parathyroid glands","PossibleSymptoms":"Bone fracture,Hard defecation,Bloated feeling in the stomach,Tiredness,Back pain,Pain in the limbs,Less than 3 defecations per week,Abdominal pain,Vomiting,Nausea,Reduced appetite,Increased urine quantity,Flatulence,Mood swings,Difficult defecation","ProfName":"Hyperparathyroidism","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Treatments of hyperparathyroidism will depend on the causes. The high blood level of calcium and parathyroid hormone can be adjusted by low calcium and low phosphate diet and with medications such as calcitriol and cinacalcet. Drinking enough water can prevent the development of kidney stones. The degradation of bone mass can be reduced with medications like bisphosphonates and, for women, estrogen-like substances. Besides, regular exercise can strengthen the bones. When the hyperparathyroidism is caused by a medical condition, then the treatment is aimed at treating the underlying disease. In case of hyperplasia or a benign tumor, surgery will be foreseen. If the hyperparathyroidism is caused by cancer, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary."}
