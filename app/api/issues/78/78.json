{"Description":"Tick-borne encephalitis is an infectious viral infectious disease which impactes the central nervous system of a person. Over the past decades, TBE has become an increasing public health concern in Asia and Europe and it is the most important viral tick-borne disease which exists Eastern Europe, Central Europe as well as Russia.","DescriptionShort":"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an infectious viral disease transmitted by ticks and in certain cases it can lead to inflammation of the brain or the meninges. There are three forms of the disease related to the virus subtypes: namely, Siberian, Far Eastern and European.","MedicalCondition":"Ticks that carry the TBE virus are widespread throughout the TBE-belt (Eurasia). One to four weeks after being bitten by an infected tick, flu-like symptoms such as headaches, lethargy, fever, and joint pain occur. In most cases the illness disappears after that.  However, in 5-15% of those affected, after a symptom-free period, a new wave of illness develops into meningoencephalitis (inflammation and infection of the meninges and brain), which is experienced as headaches, sensitivity to light, dizziness, and impaired walking.","Name":"Tick-borne encephalitis","PossibleSymptoms":"Sensitivity to glare,Fever,Impaired balance,Pain in the limbs,Headache,Paralysis,Tiredness,Disorientation regarding time or place","ProfName":"Early summer meningoencephalitis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Paralysis of the limbs or facial nerves is rare in cases of TBE, but the disease is fatal in 1% of those who contract it. There is no treatment for TBE, but the symptoms can be alleviated. There is a vaccine for the TBE virus and people who live in or often visit high-risk areas for TBE are advised to get the vaccine. Tips for dealing with tick bites: 1) One can prevent tick bites by wearing long sleeves and pants, staying out of the under bush and areas with tall grass, and checking oneself for ticks after the excursion. 2) If the person is bitten by a tick, he should remove it from his skin with a pair of tweezers (some tweezers are made especially for this purpose) without crushing the tick and then disinfect the bite area. One should not use oil or other substances to “suffocate” the tick - this will only cause the tick to expel any pathogens it carries."}
