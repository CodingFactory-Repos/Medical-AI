{"Description":"Colon cancer is a cancer that affects the large intestine that is the lower part of the digestive system. Rectal cancer is a cancer that affects the last inches of the colon. The two conditions together are named colorectal cancers. Most cases of colon cancer start as noncancerous, small, benign clumps of cells. In this case, they can produce few, if any, symptoms at all. That is why doctors recommend regular screening tests, which is basically a proactive prevention strategy for colon cancer by having an early detection and if needed removal of clumps of cells before they can become malignant.","DescriptionShort":"Colon cancer is a malignant tumor of the large intestine. It is the second most common cancer in men and women over 50 years old. It attacks surrounding tissues, and cancer cells can migrate into other organs. Often there are no early symptoms so regular check-ups with a colonoscopy is recommended for people older than 50 years old. Treatment consists of surgical removal with or without chemotherapy or radiation.","MedicalCondition":"Most cases of colon cancer (90%) begin as small, benign accumulations of cells called adenomatous polyps. Over some years, some of these polyps slowly become malignant and turn into colon cancer. Risk factors for colon cancer include: 1) improper diet with high-fat, low fibre and a high intake of red meats, 2) having colorectal polyps, 3) having inflammatory bowel disease, 4) having a positive family history, 5) inherited disease such as familial adenomatous polyposis or 6) long history of smoking or drinking alcohol. People with colon cancer may have symptoms such abdominal pain and tenderness, blood in the stool, diarrhoea, difficult defecation and weight loss without known cause, fever or night sweats. Screenings can help diagnosing colon cancer in an early stage. Those are physical examinations with rectal palpations as well as regular colonoscopies for persons above the age of 50. An early detection improves the chances of a successful treatment.","Name":"Colon cancer","PossibleSymptoms":"Blood in stool,Difficult defecation,Black stools,Weight loss,Flatulence,Abdominal pain,Less than 3 defecations per week","ProfName":"Colorectal cancer","Synonyms":"Rectal cancer,Bowel cancer","TreatmentDescription":"Treatments of colon cancer depend on the stage of the cancer and include: 1) Surgery with complete removal of the cancer cells: Early stage (Stage 0) colon cancer may be removed by colonoscopy to eliminate the cancer cells. For stages 1, 2, and 3, a more invasive surgery known as a partial colon resection is required to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. 2) Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells: patients with stage 3 colon cancer normally receive chemotherapy for 6-8 months after surgery. It is also used to reduce symptoms and to prolong the survival of patients with stage 4 colon cancer. 3) Radiation therapy to destroy the cancerous tissue is usually used in the presence of rectal cancers to reduce their size before surgery. Most important in prevention of colorectal cancer is a regular check-up with a colonoscopy for people older than 50 years."}
