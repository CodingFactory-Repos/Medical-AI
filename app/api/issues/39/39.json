{"Description":"Special perspiratory glands inside the ear canal cause earwax. Its purpose is usually to wet and to clean the ear canal. Overproduction or improper cleaning, e.g. with cotton swabs, can cause the earwax to gather in front of the eardrum where it may dry out and block the ear canal.","DescriptionShort":"Cerumen obturans is the medical term for earwax. It is mainly used when the ear canal is blocked with earwax, which can cause sudden hearing problems and ringing in the ears.","MedicalCondition":"A sudden hearing impairment of one ear is the main symptom for cerumen obturans. The hearing impairment often occurs after the ear canal has been in contact with water, because dried earwax soaks with water, expands and therefore closes the ear canal completely. Another common symptom is ringing in the ears (tinnitus). This can also be caused by earwax closing the outer ear canal.","Name":"Earwax blockage","PossibleSymptoms":"Feeling of pressure in the ear,Impaired hearing,Itching in the ear,Ringing in the ear,Earache","ProfName":"Impacted cerumen","Synonyms":"Earwax clog,Cerumen impaction","TreatmentDescription":"Descriptions of the symptoms lead the doctor to an assumption that will be verified by an endoscopy of the ear canal. The earwax will then be removed from the ear canal. There are various ways to remove it, such as suction, rinsing with warm water or usage of hydrogen peroxide. To prevent the build-up of earwax into an impaction itâ€™s suggested to avoid cleaning the ears with cotton swabs, but to rinse it regularly. This is preferred to be done by a doctor, because the eardrum and middle ear may become damaged if removal is not professionally executed."}
