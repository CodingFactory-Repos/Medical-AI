{"Description":"In otitis externa, the inflammation is limited to the outside of the ear channel and does not spread beyond the eardrum. The condition is called often ‘swimmer’s ear’ since frequent contact to water can cause the ear tunnel to be more exposed to inflammation. Symptoms of otitis externa can improve within a few days with treatment and such short otitis externa is referred as ‘acute’ but some otitis externa can last for numerous months or maybe for longer and are referred as ‘chronic’.","DescriptionShort":"The inflammation of the outer ear canal, also known as otitis externa, affects the ear canal and can sometimes attack the pinna (visible part of the ear). It manifests as strong ear aches, urge to itch inside the ear, as well as reddened, swollen, and sometimes crusted skin in the outer ear. The condition is caused usually by an infection. Sometimes, irritation or allergy can be the cause.","MedicalCondition":"It is predominantly adults who are affected, especially those with injuries to the ear canal, or who have not cleaned the ear properly, or who suffer from diabetes or immuno-deficiencies. This kind of infection is noticeable due to intense earaches and the urge to itch inside the ear. The skin of the outer ear canal can become red and swollen, much like a small skin nodule, blister (including pus-filled blisters), and crusted. Pulling on the earlobes and pressing on the outer ear are painful.","Name":"Inflammation of the external ear canal","PossibleSymptoms":"Feeling of pressure in the ear,Impaired hearing,Itching in the ear,Earache,Swollen glands in the neck,Headache","ProfName":"Otitis externa","Synonyms":"Swimmer's ear,Inflammation of the outer ear and ear canal","TreatmentDescription":"Diabetics are frequently affected by aggressive bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which requires treatment with antibiotics over the course of several weeks. Treatment depends on the cause, which is not always known. Minor infections can be treated with vinegar water (one part vinegar, one part water) dripped into the ear. More serious cases can be treated with eardrops with antibiotics. An allergic inflammation of the outer ear canal can be treated with anti-inflammatory ear drops (such as cortisone)."}
