{"Description":"A trigger finger results from an inflammation happening in the sheath surrounding the tendon ant the tendon of a finger itself. The inflammation will cause the affected finger to be stuck in a position because the tendon is unable to pass through its sheath (the annular ligament mostly builds the obstacle). This causes the finger to stay in its bent position until the pulling force is strong enough to tug the tendon through the obstacle. Thereby results the typically flipping straightening motion.","DescriptionShort":"A trigger finger is a condition which occurs when the affected finger has a restraint in straightening. The finger stays bent at the beginning of straightening and then suddenly straightens with a flipping movement. The movements are like pulling and releasing a trigger. Anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently used to treat the condition. A surgery will be necessary if the treatment does not work.","MedicalCondition":"The cause of a trigger finger is mainly an inflammation. Once an inflammation occurs in the tendon of a finger, it may cause swelling and the related stiffness. As a result, the affected finger will become locked and bent for a while, and then it may suddenly straighten with a snap. The movements are like pulling and releasing a trigger. And a trigger finger often happens to the thumb, middle finger and ring finger but every finger can be affected. If the condition is severe, then the affected finger may even stay in the bent position and be unable to straighten ever again. The risks of getting a trigger finger are related to the working environment, lifestyle and any other diseases. For example, people who need to repeat actions like clicking, gripping and typing during work are more likely to have the problem. Besides, diseases such as arthritis and diabetes can also increase the risk. People with a trigger finger may experience symptoms not only such as a finger stuck like pulling a trigger, but they may also feel nodules, tenderness, stiffness and pain at the affected area.","Name":"Trigger finger","PossibleSymptoms":"Limited mobility of the fingers","ProfName":"Tendinitis stenosans","Synonyms":"Trigger thumb,Trigger digit","TreatmentDescription":"The treatment of a trigger finger is to reduce the inflammation and swelling. Treatments often include medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can help to relieve the inflammation as well as the pain. If the treatment does not work, a local injection with steroid or a surgery will be necessary. The goal of surgery is to remove the bottleneck (mostly through a cut of the A1 annular ligament) so the tendon is able to slide smoothly again."}
