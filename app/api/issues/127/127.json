{"Description":"Most anal fissures heal after a few days or weeks with home treatment. Such conditions are called acute anal fissures. However, if the affected person has an anal fissure that has not healed after eight to twelve weeks, then the condition is considered as chronic fissure and may need further medical treatment.","DescriptionShort":"An anal fissure is a tear in the skin or the anal mucosa and is usually painful during bowel movements. Anal fissure does not lead to more serious issues. It is a common problem that affects people of all ages, particularly also young and healthy people.","MedicalCondition":"An anal fissure can develop due to constipation or diarrhea, after giving birth, from certain sexual practices (such as anal sex), or due to other medical issues with the anus. An anal fissure is very painful and leads to increased tension in the sphincter of the anus. This in turn worsens constipation and creates a negative feedback loop. An anal fissure may bleed or even cause itching.","Name":"Tear in the skin of anus","PossibleSymptoms":"Blood in stool,Hard defecation,Painful defecation,Cramps,Pain of the anus,Itching of the anus,Difficult defecation,Less than 3 defecations per week","ProfName":"Anal fissure","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The danger of anal fissures is that symptoms remain unhealed (and become chronic).

If this treatment shows no results, surgery becomes necessary."}
