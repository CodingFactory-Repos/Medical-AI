{"Description":"ALS damages the nerves in a way that the muscles they operate canâ€™t be used anymore. The condition is not curable and progresses usually fast. The average survival time is only 3.5 years.","DescriptionShort":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease of the central nervous system that progresses fast and leads to impairment of movements, but also speaking, swallowing and breathing.","MedicalCondition":"The onset of this disease is gradual and shows only few specific symptoms. A first sign is an increasing decline of the small hand muscles; however it usually does not lead to loss of power, so patients may not be aware. Only at a later stage, when about 50% of the nerves are damaged, involuntary muscle cramps occur, especially in the legs. Upon further progression of nerve damage, patients will suffer from difficulties in speaking and swallowing. Breathing becomes increasingly difficult as well.","Name":"Disease of the motor neurons","PossibleSymptoms":"Muscular weakness in the arm,Muscular weakness in the leg,Muscular atrophy of the arm,Muscular atrophy in the leg,Physical inactivity,Finger deformity,Weight loss,Difficult defecation,Increased salivation,Immobilization,Difficulty in speaking,Difficulty in swallowing,Shortness of breath","ProfName":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Synonyms":"ALS,Lou Gehrig's disease,Charcot disease,Motor neurone disease,MND","TreatmentDescription":"Unfortunately there is no treatment for the cause of ALS, only the symptoms can be reduced. This includes physiotherapy and speech therapy, to enable the patients to live a generally independent life. Medication can be used to treat muscle cramps, and if a patient chokes too much, a tube for artificial nutrition can be considered. As the nerve damage also causes difficulties in breathing, machine ventilation becomes necessary in almost all cases."}
