{"Description":"Candida is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including the human body. Usually, a person's immune system keeps it under control. However if a person has an immune system deficiency or he is taking antibiotics, the fungus may multiply and cause a local or even systemic infection called candidiasis.","DescriptionShort":"Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Treatment of candidiasis can be either external or antifungal medications. A specialist will help determine the cause and then offer appropriate treatment.","MedicalCondition":"Candidiasis may occur anywhere in the human body. There are different forms of yeast infection, depending upon the area affected. Most commonly, the mouth, vagina and skin areas are affected, as yeast grows there naturally. For example: 1) thrush is a yeast infection that causes white patches in the mouth, 2) candida esophagitis is thrush that spreads to your esophagus which makes swallowing hard and painful, 3) women may get vaginitis, which is a vaginal yeast infection, causing itchiness, pain and smelly discharge, 4) yeast infection of the skin cause itching and rashes and 5) yeast infections in your bloodstream may be life-threatening. These only occur if your immune system is deficient like in HIV\/AIDS. However local infections often occur after an antibiotics treatment.","Name":"Yeast infection","PossibleSymptoms":"Difficulty in swallowing,Mouth pain,Dry mouth","ProfName":"Candidiasis","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"Candidiasis infection levels may be lowered by daily personal hygiene and careful intake of antibiotics.
