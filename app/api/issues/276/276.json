{"Description":"Stability of the knee joint is achieved by muscles, joint capsules, and ligaments. Twisting the knee can tear the ligaments, such as the cruciate ligaments that attach the upper leg bone to the lower leg bone in the knee joint. This can lead to instability of the knee joint and later to the articular cartilage and meniscus. Common causes for injury to the knee’s ligaments include twisting the knee when playing soccer or when skiing.","DescriptionShort":"A twisted knee can tear the knee ligaments, which can lead to instability in the knee joint. The knee ligament is strong tissue band connecting the thigh bone to the shin bone at the knee joint. It helps to control the back-and-forth motion of the lower leg.","MedicalCondition":"The knee joint is the most commonly treated and injured joint in humans. Patients complain of swelling, pain, limited movement in the knee joint, and often report having heard a noticeable sound after an accident occurred. Depending on the location of the ligament injury, a doctor can use specific tests to provoke instability of the joint, so that the ligament injury can be identified.","Name":"Knee ligament injury","PossibleSymptoms":"Knee pain,Knee deformity","ProfName":"Collateral or cruciate ligament injury","Synonyms":null,"TreatmentDescription":"The therapy is individually planned based on the patient’s age, secondary injuries and activity level. The degree of the knee’s instability is also important for the decision to perform surgery. Especially younger, physically active patients will usually be operated. This is mainly the case for a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament and will be performed 4-6 weeks after the accident at the earliest. The posterior cruciate ligament can usually be treated conservatively, without surgery. A complete dislocation of the knee-joint is an emergency that can damage nerves and vessels and therefore requires immediate surgery."}
